Dynamic Components:
<p>The initial API for the dynamic creation and mobilitity of Components
has
<br>been created.&nbsp; In particular, a new "ComponentMessage" was created
which
<br>allows one to specify:
<br>&nbsp; - an operation: Add / Remove / Suspend / Resume / Reload
<br>&nbsp; - the MessageAddress where this command is to be sent
<br>&nbsp; - the ComponentDescription of the Component to Add/Remove/etc
<br>The ComponentDescription can specify an optional "parameter", which
will
<br>allow mobile components to specify their "state" prior to movement.&nbsp;
Other
<br>higher-level Messages may be created in a future release, such as a
<br>"MoveComponentMessage" and atomic-transaction/security support.
<p>Currently only Nodes and Clusters are MessageTargets, so one can only
<br>send these message to Nodes (to add/remove/etc a Cluster) and to Clusters
<br>(to add/remove/etc a Plugin).&nbsp; Plugins will be provided a MessageTransport
<br>service which will allow Plugins to create and send these messages.
<p>For the initial implementation only the addition of new Clusters and
Plugins
<br>is supported until the requisite Container support is provided in the
<br>infrastructure (namely Node and ClusterImpl).&nbsp; Developers can
create and
<br>send any ComponentMessage, but for now non-"add" ComponentMessages
will
<br>generate a warning and be ignored.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Console/Server redesign:
<p>The remote creation and management of Nodes, i.e. the "NodeServer" and
it's
<br>GUI "Console", have been redesigned:
<br>&nbsp; - Separated RMI code from client (Console)
<br>&nbsp; - Created a simple three-interface API for console developers,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with all RMI-specific code in the "rmi"
package
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (details in the package-level javadocs:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "cougaar/server/src/org/cougaar/tools/server/index.html")
<br>&nbsp; - Renamed RMI-specific code to follow easier-to-understand
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; naming conventions (details in the package-level
javadocs:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "cougaar/server/src/org/cougaar/tools/server/rmi/index.html").
<br>&nbsp; - Added Node registration back to the server, which allows the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; client (Console) to directly contact
the Node
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e.g. ask the Node for a List of all
it's ClusterIdentifiers)
<br>&nbsp; - Added a "listener" pattern for the client (Console) to receive
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notification of events within the Node
<br>&nbsp; - Refactored Console to be a simple example of a server-client
--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the future it should be removed from
this package.
<br>These modifications will allow for a more powerful Console to be created
with
<br>greater control over the Nodes.&nbsp; These modifications also required
the
<br>addition
<br>of three core "ExternalNode*" classes to
<br>"cougaar/core/src/org/cougaar/core/society" and the modification of
Node to
<br>create and register an RMI "hook" for the remote server.&nbsp; For
the typical
<br>command-line Node invocation these modifications are disabled.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Dynamic PSP load/unload:
<p>The PSP "?LOAD" and "?UNLOAD" capability has been enhanced.&nbsp; These
<br>PSP-services
<br>now produce better HTTP interfaces for browsers, and the URL parameters
have
<br>been renamed for easier use:
<br>&nbsp; ?LOAD?PSP_PATH=Path?CLASSNAME=JName?LOADER=URL
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Path: logical PSP location at this server
(must end with .PSP)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - JName: Java class name of 'Plan Service
Provider'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - URL: Class is loaded from this URL (optional
-- default uses
<br>server’s classpath)
<br>&nbsp; ?UNLOAD?PSP_PATH=Path?CONFIRM_UNLOAD=Confirm
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Path: logical PSP location at this server
(must end with .PSP)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Confirm: Use "Yes", otherwise the user is
prompted for a yes/no value
<br>The "?LOADER" parameter of the PSP "?LOAD" now correctly loads PSP
from remote
<br>URL locations.

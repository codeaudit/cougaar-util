    <h1>Installing Cougaar</h1>

    The following installation instructions are also covered in the
    <a href="http://tutorials.cougaar.org/CougaarOverview.ppt">Cougaar Overview Slides</a>.
    <p>

    <ol>
      <li>
      <b>Requirements:</b><br>
      Ensure that Java 1.5+ is installed and on the system
      path.  To download the JDK, visit <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com</a>.
      Both SDKs and JDKs for Java 1.5 and 1.6 are supported.
      <p>
      No special operating system or hardware is required.  Cougaar developers use a
      variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX.  SMP and
      HyperThreading are fully supported.  
      </li>
      <p>

      <li>
      Create a Cougaar directory (ie "C:/Cougaar") and set a "COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH"
      environment variable to point to this directory.</li>
      <p>
      We recommend that you put COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/bin on your PATH environment
      variable, for easy access to the "cougaar" startup script.</li>
      <p>

      <li>
      Download the latest release version of Cougaar from <a
      href="http://cougaar.org/projects/cougaar">http://cougaar.org/projects/cougaar/</a>.
      Or, download the latest nightly build from 
      <a href="http://build.cougaar.org/auto/HEAD/latest_success/"
        >http://build.cougaar.org/auto/HEAD/latest_success/</a>.
      <p>

      <li>
      Unzip the desired zip files into your COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH.<br>
      The following two are required:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><b><i>cougaar.zip</i></b>, which contains the core
        cougaar infrastructure.</li>
        <li><b><i>cougaar-support.zip</i></b>, which contains all
        required 3<sup>rd</sup> party support jars.  The jar versions are
        documented in the <a href="../sys/index.html">sys/index.html</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      The other zips, such as cougaar-src.zip and cougaar-api.zip, are optional.
      <p>
      For additional details on the zip files and their contents, see the 
      <a href="Contents.html">Contents.html</a>.
      </li>
      <p>

      <li>
      You should now be able to run the "ping" application, as documented in the
      <a href="http://tutorials.cougaar.org/">Cougaar Overview Slides</a>.  This will
      verify that the Cougaar installation was successful and demonstrate a basic Cougaar
      application.
      <p>
      The "Pizza Party" application is a second demonstration application that's included
      in the Cougaar release.  It focuses on the Task/Allocation planning domain and
      service provider discovery.  For details, please see the 
      <a href="http://tutorials.cougaar.org/pizza">Online "Pizza Party" documentation</a>,
      <a href="../pizza/doc/Readme.html">Pizza Readme File</a>, and
      <a href="getting_started.html">Getting Started Guide</a>.</li>

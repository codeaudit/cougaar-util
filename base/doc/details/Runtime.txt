COUGAAR Infrastructure Runtime glossary and discussion

Symbols output during execution:
	'.'	"heartbeat" indicates that the VM (Node) is relatively 
		idle (and hasn't crashed).  '.' is printed by a
		one-per-vm low-priority process at most once every 5
		seconds.

	'+'	Indicates that a Message was sent by a cluster in this 
		node.  This includes messages send by a cluster to
		iteself, but does not include messages send by
		non-clusters (e.g. by Node initialization processes).

	'-'	Indicates that a Message was received by a cluster,
		including loopback messages.  Does not imply *any*
		processing of the message.

	'^'	Indicates that a call has been been to Objectspace's
		Voyager API.  Voyager is known to be a memory hog.

	'@'	Indicates that a remote management console has requested
		information from the node.

	'~'	Indicates that a the local management console has polled
		all nodes it knows for updated management data.
	
Other symbols may appear from time to time - mostly due to debugging
and tracing of experimental code.  The above symbols are retained
because of their utility to human viewers, not for any technical
reason.

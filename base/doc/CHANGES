* 8.6.1
New plugin scheduler allows running plugins (and other clients) from a
pool of threads managed on a per-node basis rather than a single
thread on a per-agent basis.  Improved resource utilization
(especially on SMP machines), reduced thread load for nodes with > 2
agents, simpler scheduling rules (simple fifo queue over pool).

* 8.6.0

* 8.4.1

* 8.4.0

* 8.3.0
The Component chain Node->AgentManager->Agent/Cluster->PluginManager->Plugin 
is complete, with appropriate Binders and connection of ServiceBrokers
so that low-level compoents can request high-level services.

Binders control construction of components rather than the container.

Wrapping Binders are now functional - see ServiceFilter and
ServiceFilterBinder as examples.  ServiceFilterBinder is a base class
for installing Service monitors/proxies/wrappers between a standard
binder and the component.  There is an example of an instantiable
extension in core/examples/org/cougaar/core/examples/PluginServiceFilter.java
PluginServiceFilter monitors new subscription requests of the bound plugin.

* 8.2.2
New INI file format to support BinderFactory loading:
  "insertionPoint = classname(Vector of Strings)"
with backwards-compatibility for "cluster = " and "plugin = ".
Node has been modified to load Components using ComponentDescriptions.

* 8.2.1
ComponentModel name change: org.cougaar.core.component.Services has
been renamed ServiceBroker to better reflect the function of the
class as decided during the June 2001 BBN CDR (and as documented in
the distributed CDR slides).  Various other component/service model
classes, methods, and argument names were modified to match
(e.g. BindingSite.getServices() -> BindingSite.getServiceBroker()).

* 8.2.0

Initial integration of Component and Service Model (CSM).  Reimplementation
of PlugInAdapter in terms of CSM.  First pass reimplementation of
MessageTransport.

Forward-port 7.2 (ALP Demo2000) features and bugfixes into 8.x world.

* MB 8.0.1

Ported all XML code to use a single API, specifically Xerces-1.3.1.
The majority of changes was the removal of old import statements that
referenced old IBM parsers.

org.cougaar.util.ConfigFinder was modifed to use the the DOMParser when
reading in an XML file.  It also now contains an inner class that extends
EntityResolver.  This new class is used to locate, via the config finder
methods, any required DTD's that are defined within XML files.

All files that serialized XML code now use XMLSerializable, which is the
only way to serialize an XML document in Xerces.

* MB 8.0

JDK 1.3 support.  For the most part, this is a port of javaiopatch,
but we are also using the RMI1.2 protocol exclusively, and a number of
methods have changed exception handing slightly.

Nearly all remaining references to "ALP" have been replaced by
project-neutral names, often "COUGAAR".  See core/doc/8.0/unalp for
the conversion script (in perl) which was used and unalp.out for the
output of that conversion script.  Documentation files were generally
not changed, so you will continue to see references to old symbols in
ChangeLogs and so forth.  The following classes were renamed as a
result of running the script:
glm/src/org/cougaar/domain/glm/ldm/plan/ALPRelationship.java -> GLMRelationship.java
glm/src/org/cougaar/domain/glm/ldm/asset/ALPAsset.java -> GLMAsset.java
glm/src/org/cougaar/domain/glm/ldm/ALPFactory.java -> GLMFactory.java
glm/src/org/cougaar/domain/glm/ldm/ALPDomain.java -> GLMDomain.java
glm/src/org/cougaar/domain/glm/util/GLMAsset.java -> AssetUtil.java
glm/src/org/cougaar/domain/mlm/ui/views/ALPConsumer.java -> MLMConsumer.java
glm/src/org/cougaar/domain/mlm/ui/producers/ALPProducer.java -> MLMProducer.java
glm/src/org/cougaar/domain/mlm/ui/producers/ThreadedALPProducer.java -> ThreadedMLMProducer.java
core/src/org/cougaar/core/cluster/ALPPlanServesLogicProvider.java -> BlackboardServesLogicProvider.java
core/src/org/cougaar/core/cluster/XPlanServesALPPlan.java -> XPlanServesBlackboard.java
core/src/org/cougaar/core/cluster/ALPPlan.java -> Blackboard.java
server/src/org/cougaar/tools/server/ALPServer.java -> NodeServer.java
server/src/org/cougaar/tools/server/RemoteALPServer.java -> RemoteNodeServer.java
server/src/org/cougaar/tools/server/RemoteALPServerImpl.java -> RemoteNodeServerImpl.java

What had been called the "alp" domain should now be loaded as
"glm".  To support this, Domains may implement a method to return
alias names.  Use of the aliases results in a warning, but otherwise
everything will work - Aliases may be disabled at some point to force
people to use the official name exclusively.  All core modules have
been updated to use "glm" over "alp", but "alp" and "mlm" may also be
used in the interim.

XML support is in the process of upgrading to use the standard XERCES
package which is part of the APACHE project.  Until complete, COUGAAR
will continue to require both XERCES and IBM's XML4J.  We expect this
to be fixed in the next minor release (8.0.1).

Initial checkin of Component Model with BindingSite, Binder.  See
org.cougaar.core.component.* for information.  This is still a work in
progress.  Expect to see some parts of cougaar infrastructure ported
to the component model in the next release (8.0.1).

* MB 7.2

Minor patches.  Released as a separate supported build as the basis
for Alpine's 2001 demo branch line (branch tag "V7_2").

* MB 7.0.2

Minor Patches.  Released as a separate supported build because of
patch buildup.

* MB 7.0.1

Default database connection information has been moved out of all
standard ".q" and ".cfg" files.  This means that Parameters are now 
required, either from a .cougaarrc file (was .alprc - see below) or as
-D arguments on the java command line (org.cougaar.database,
org.cougaar.database.user, org.cougaar.database.password).

Parameters files have changed a bit.  Previous versions used the file
.alprc as found in the ConfigPath.  Now, parameters are set first from
a file ".cougaarrc" in $HOME and then by the file cougaar.rc somewhere
in ConfigPath (e.g. in your society's config directory).  This allows,
for instance, databases to be selected in the the config directory but
have individual usernames and passwords set outside on a per-user
basis.  See the javadoc for org.cougaar.util.Parameters for more
information.   A (non-functional) example of the format expected in
these files is in this directory (core/doc) as "example.cougaarrc".

At this point, .alprc is still searched for and used as before, albeit
with warnings that they will be ignored in some future release.

Changed the third party charting software from Sitraka (was KLGroup) 
jcchart400K.jar to an upgrade of jcchart451K.jar.   Enables Inventory GUI 
improvements.  Cannot mix and match different builds of glm and core.

Promoted Delta's DBConnectionPool facility to org.cougaar.util.

* MB 7.0

Package reorganization to support COUGAAR opensource release 7.0.
Details may be found in 7.0/alp7.pkg.  Changes are reflected in
javadocs and other documentation.

* MB 6.8.2

New PG in alp domain LocationSchedulePG is maintained by
OrgRTDataPlugin (for "Home location") and by new OPlanWatcherLP (for
oplan-directed location assignments).  It is up to consumers to
interpret the schedule and assign semantics.  However, a useful method
is TimeSpanSet.getMinimalIntersectingElement(long time) which when
called on a schedule, will return the shortest element overlapping the
specified time.  This is experimental functionality at this point.

NOTE: TimeSpan MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE are no longer == Long.MIN_VALUE
and MAX_VALUE.  This should not effect correct code, but you
might notice slightly different dates in UIs for elements which
represent unbounded time.  It is very important that you not use
Long.MIN/MAX_VALUE for schedules - *always* use TimeSpan.MIN/MAX_VALUE.

* MB 6.8.1

bugfixes

* MB 6.8

The new classloading Node bootstrapper may cause problems with certain 
IDEs.  There are two workarounds:
	1. call Node.launch instead of Node.main.
	2. pass -Dalp.useBootstrapper=false to java command.
Both options require that the classpath be complete and correct, as
the bootstrapper will not do any jar-file searching.

Also, the Bootstrapper's classloader will not load any classes which
start with "java.", "javax.", "sun.", "com.sun." or "net.jini.".  This 
list may be extended by supplying a -Dalp.bootstrapper.exclusions=foo.:bar.
System property.  The value of the property should be a list of 
package prefixes separated by colon (":") characters.

New System property alp.message.fastTransport=true (default is false)
optimizes the rmi message transport for societies where nodes usually
contain multiple clusters.  This option instructs the RMI
MessageTransport to:
 1. send messages via one thread-per node rather than one per cluster
when possible. 
 2. registers each cluster as a redirect to the appropriate node. 
In addition, by default, each node will only register one server
object regardless of how many clusters are served (e.g. multiple
name entries will refer to the same server object).
fastTransport and all the detailed settings it controls
(useNodeDelivery, useNodeRedirect, useServerProxies, useLocalDelivery) 
may be mixed freely within a society so can be used to tune
communities or individual nodes.

The patch to java.io.ObjectInputStream which previously had sources in
the core module and was built into alpio.jar, has been moved to its
own module "javaiopatch".  All the scripts have been updated
accordingly. 

* MB 6.6

Add Automatic generation of "rate" measures in terms of base
measures. See core/doc/details/MeasureWriter.txt for details on new
and old features.  (this part back-patched into MB 6.4.1)
All "rate" measures now implement the interface alp.ldm.measures.Rate.
The old (misnamed) Rate class is still available as AbstractRate.
	
Add support for DataQuality measures on PropertyGroups.  Details are
described in core/doc/details/DataQuality.txt

Replaced old directive message serialization technique with a
lighter-weight solution.  Greatly simplifies most old ldm object
serialization code and allows finally dropping the old persistence
mechanism (long unused).

LogicProviders now appear to publish to the plan instantaneously
rather than having to wait for the end of the transaction.  This makes 
the run model of LPs internally consistant - that is, they are both
invoked at a sub-transaction level and (now) have visibility into the
logplan at the same level of granularity.

PlugIns may now use DynamicUnaryPredicate rather than UnaryPredicate
for subscribing using predicates which select for things which are
expected to change.  Essentially, the new facility will automatically
add or remove objects as a result of change events when the internal
collection is out of phase with the current state of the objects.
There is considerable overhead when using these predicates, so it is
not the default.  It still may only be used for standard subscriptions
(CollectionSubscription and IncrementalSubscription and extensions),
and the base objects that are being selected must be publishChanged by
someone in order to pick up the modifications.

PlugIn.query(UnaryPredicate) is now *much* more efficient than
one-shot subscriptions.  PlugIn should now use query in place of any
existing subscribe/unsubscribe patterns.

New Transaction objects are kept in thread-local references.
Transaction contains the rendezvous point between ChangeReports (which 
had incorrectly been stored on the Publishable objects) and the
subscriber/plan mechanisms.  Also provides a useful hook to whatif
processing.

Old (broken) persistence support has been dropped entirely.  The new
(working) persistence support has been merged into the old package.

The DomainManager will now first initialize Domains from properties
(as before, looking for System properties of the form "alp.domain.foo=...") 
and then from a config file "LDMDomains.ini".  The alpine tree has one 
of these files set up in the configs/common directory for alpine demo
use.  We expect that most people will prefer to the file method, but
both are retained for compatability and flexibility.

Node now uses Bootstrapper to re-classload itself with searched-for
jars, etc.  The makes it possible to start alp with only core.jar in
the classpath.  Startup scripts have been updated (simplified)
accordingly.  Classpath is still honored, and takes precedence over
searched-for jars.  See alp.society.Bootstrapper for more information.

New (non-core) module "server" implements an application-server-like
mechanism for running nodes (and societies) remotely.  This facility
is intended to be used for testing&integration and (perhaps) demo
use. See server/doc/README for basic documentation and instructions.

* MB 6.4 

New default behavior for BehaviorGroups. See
core/doc/details/BehaviorGroups.txt for details.

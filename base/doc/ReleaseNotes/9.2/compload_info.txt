Added new "AgentContainmentService" for the servlet to use.  Modified "/load"
servlet to use this new service instead of sending a ComponentMessage.  The
Servlet requests now block until the action is performed (or fails).

Added new "?action=VALUE" URL parameter.  Here's the relevant javadocs:
       --------------------------------------------------------
       Required action for container operation; this should 
       be either "add", "remove", or "contains", where the 
       default is "add".
       
       Important Note:
       
       "add" acts as an "ensure-is-loaded"; if the component 
       is already loaded then the action is ignored (success).  
       
       "remove" similarily acts as an "ensure-is-not-loaded", 
       where a remove of a non-loaded component is ignored 
       (success).

       "contains" will only return with a success status code 
       if the component is loaded ("assert-is-loaded").  If
       the component is not loaded then an error response
       is returned.
       --------------------------------------------------------

Loading into the node (e.g. add an agent) is now temporarily disabled, pending
the node-agent implementation.  Under node-agent the node itself will have a
"/load" servlet that will allow load/unload of agents.

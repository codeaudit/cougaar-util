If you wish to use the Stoplight Chart, you must add the RemoteSubscriptionPlugin 
to all agents in the society (except for the aggregation agent).  
Currently, however, CSMART treats node agents slightly different than other agents.  

If you create a recipe to insert the RemoteSubscriptionPlugin into all agents, 
this will not cause the plugin to be added to any node agents.  
To get around this, you must modify your query to insert the RemoteSubscriptionPlugin 
into "node" components as wellas "agent" components.  To accomplish this, you can use 
this query when inserting the RemoteSubscriptionPlugin into agents 
(Note that for this to work, the agent name must be 'AggAgent'):


recipeQueryNotAggAgent=\
 SELECT COMPONENT_ALIB_ID FROM V4_ALIB_COMPONENT WHERE COMPONENT_TYPE in ('agent', 'node') 
 AND COMPONENT_NAME NOT IN ('AggAgent')

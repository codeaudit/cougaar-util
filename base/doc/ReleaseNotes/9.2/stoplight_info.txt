If you wish to use the Stoplight Chart, 
you must add the RemoteSubscriptionPlugin 
to all agents in the society (except for the aggregation agent).  

Currently, however, CSMART does not recognize node agents as agents.  

If you create a recipe to insert the RemoteSubscriptionPlugin into all agents, 
this will not cause the plugin to be added to any node agents.  
To get around this, you must create an XML file containing the org hierarchy 
in $CIP/blackjack/data/assessment/orgTree.xml.  
The Stoplight Chart will then use this file rather than query the society.  
This file should contain all agents in the society *not including* the aggregation agent 
and any node agents.  
This means that the node agents still won't have the plugin, 
but it won't matter because the Stoplight Chart won't try to access those agents. 

Additionally, you must make sure that the RemoteSubscriptionPlugin 
is *not* inserted into the aggregation agent node.  
To accomplish this, you must use this query when inserting the RemoteSubscriptionPlugin 
into agents (Note that for this to work, the agent name must be 'AggAgent'): 

recipeQueryNotAggAgent=\
 SELECT COMPONENT_ALIB_ID FROM V4_ALIB_COMPONENT WHERE COMPONENT_TYPE = 
 'agent' AND COMPONENT_NAME NOT IN ('AggAgent') 
  

The referenced file is checked in as orgTree.xml.sample.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Minimal service implementations can be useful as a way to expose
resource utilization issues in large services like the MTS and Thread
Service.  As part of 11.0, we developed very simple implementations of
these services which can be activated at runtime with -D flags.  The
two are described very briefly below.

<h2>Minimal MTS</h2>

<p>The minimal implementation is designed to work in a single-node
society.  This version uses a single implementation instance for the
service, which does direct calls on the recipient Agent to deliver
messages.

<p> To use this service, set the following <code>vm_parameter</code>

<pre>
-Dorg.cougaar.mts.singlenode=true
</pre>


<h2>Minimal Thread Services</h2>

<p>The minimal implementation uses a very simple thread pool, with no
Schedulers or Controllers.  The ThreadListenerService and
ThreadControlService will not exist at all in this case.

<p> To use this service, set the following <code>vm_parameter</code>

<pre>
-Dorg.cougaar.thread.trivial=true
</pre>

<h1>Thread Lanes</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Thread lanes are needed to meet two requests: handling CPU
intensive Threads (load-balancing currently makes its own thread
because lanes weren't available), and Burst Smoothing (limiting the
number of threads executing for Agents and MTS, e.g. RearB was
observed to have 300 outstanding threads).

<p>With thread lanes, threads can be organized into four (currently
hardwired) categories that have independent thread service policies.
The choice of lane is done at Scheduleable creation time and for now
cannot be changed thereafter.

<p>In the initial implementation each lane has its own pool, and each
pool in turn has its own ThreadGroup. Eventually we might be use this
to control the Java threads more directly.

<p>For 11.0 the threads lanes are defined as follows:
<ul>
  
  <li>BEST_EFFORT (initial default lane) thread may block or do other
      nasty things. </li>
      
  <li>WILL_BLOCK thread will block at some point, so use policies can
      take this into account. </li>
	  
  <li>CPU_INTENSE thread will take a lot of CPU, but promises to
      finish some time. </li>

  <li>WELL_BEHAVED thread does not block or take too much CPU. </li>

</ul>

<h2> API additions </h2>

<h3>ThreadService</h3>
<p> The following methods have been added to ThreadService:

<pre>
    Schedulable getThread(Object consumer, Runnable runnable, String name,
			  int lane);
</pre>

Makes a thread in the given lane.  The older getThread calls use the
default lane.

<h3>ThreadControlService</h3>

<p> The following methods have been added to ThreadControlService:

<pre>
    int getDefaultLane();
    void setDefaultLane(int lane);
</pre>

These get/set the default lane for the the service.

<pre>
    void setMaxRunningThreadCount(int count, int lane);
    void setQueueComparator(Comparator comparator, int lane);
    void setRightsSelector(RightsSelector selector, int lane);
    boolean setQualifier(UnaryPredicate predicate, int lane);
    boolean setChildQualifier(UnaryPredicate predicate, int lane);
    int runningThreadCount(int lane);
    int pendingThreadCount(int lane);
    int activeThreadCount(int lane);
    int maxRunningThreadCount(int lane);
</pre>

These operate on the given lane. The older control calls use the
default lane.

<h3>ThreadListenerService</h3>

<p> The following methods have been added to ThreadListenerService:

<pre>
    void addListener(ThreadListener listener, int lane);
    void removeListener(ThreadListener listener, int lane);
</pre>

This operate on the given lane. The older listener calls use the
default lane.

<h2> Example usage pattern</h2>

<ol>

  <li>MTS and Persistence could use the WILL_BLOCK lane to make
threads that will not effect the agent thread. The MTS could have a
local policy to limit the number of outstanding RMI calls to be one
per node. </li>

  <li>Agents could be marked as WELL_BEHAVED which changes the local
    policies for the default thread service. The agent should then be
    able to run with one thread (or less).</li>
    
  <li>CPU intensive threads could be started and not effect the other
  lanes. Maybe we can find a way to "nice" the underling linux
  process. In the past, that had to be done with C-code and a JNI
  class.</li>

</ol>

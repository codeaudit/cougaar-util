The directory ReleaseNotes contains all the
files that complement the file ../index.html 
(the top-level release notes file).

In the future, ../index.html should only contain
links to either the module-specific documentation
(e.g., csmart/doc) or the ReleaseNotes directory;
other directories like details, ui, or ComponentModel
will eventually be removed.

ReleaseNotes/common contains files that will
be updated/modified with each release (if necessary;
e.g., startup and config instructions).

ReleaseNotes/[ReleaseNumber] contains the new
material (e.g., 941/NewMTSEnhancements) that will
eventually be incorporated in the Cougaar Developers
Guide / Cougaar Architecture Document (i.e., according
to the updating cycles of these documents).

These scripts assist in porting core and other modules to the new package structure for Cougaar9.0.

To port infrastructure modules:
core:	core-repackage.bat mycougaarcvs/core/src mynewcougaar/core
**note its best if you specify core/src instead of just core as there are 
problems with the perl script moving/renaming files with the extra directory level.

glm:	glm-repackage.bat mycoguaarcvs/glm/src mynewcougaar/glm
** again note its beth to specify glm/src (do the rest of the module separately)
** note that a hand edit is neccessary to compile...
in org/cougaar/core/glm/ldm/asset/alpprops.def
remove domain in the following line
includedefs=org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/asset/properties.def


All other modules can be ported in total at once (instead of the module/src separately)
unless they contain org/cougaar/domain as a package structure in src.

scalability: module-repackage.bat mycougaarcvs/scalability mynewcougaar/scalability
*** note a hand edit is neccessary to compile...
in org/cougaar/tools/scalability/scalability/scalability/assets.def
remove domain in the following line:
propertydefs = scalabilityprops.def, org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/asset/properties.def

All other modules should work with:
module-repackage.bat <orig_module> <newmodule>

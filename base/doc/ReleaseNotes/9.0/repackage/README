These scripts assist in porting modules to the new package 
structure for Cougaar9.0. Note that Perl is required.

All modules can be ported using:
module-repackage.bat <top_level_src_dir>  <top_level_new_dir>
or
module-repackage <top_level_src_dir>  <top_level_new_dir>

These scripts call perl scripts within the repackaging directory and therefore must be run from the repackaging directory.

Known Issues/Problems:
1) If your src tree contains org/cougaar/domain as a package structure,
 you should repackage <my-module>/src separately from the other sub-directories 
(such as bin, doc, etc).

2) When run on windows machines, the script occasionally corrupts jars, 
 zips, gifs, jpgs, etc.  So be sure to double check the newly copied versions.

These scripts assist in porting core and other modules to the new package 
structure for Cougaar9.0.

All modules can be ported using:
module-repackage.bat <top_level_src_dir>  <top_level_new_dir>
or
module-repackage <top_level_src_dir>  <top_level_new_dir>

Note that these scripts call other scripts within the repackaging directory, 
so it should be run from the repackaging directory.

Known Issues/Problems:
1) If your src tree contains org/cougaar/domain as a package structure,
 you should repackage <my-module>/src separately from the other sub-directories 
(such as bin, doc, etc).

2) When run on windows machines, the script occasionally corrupts jars, 
 zips, gifs, jpgs, etc.  So be sure to double check the newly copied versions.

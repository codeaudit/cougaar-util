To port infrastructure modules:

core:	core-repackage.bat mycougaarcvs/core/src mynewcougaar/core
**note its best if you specify core/src instead of just core as there are 
problems with the perl script moving/renaming files with the extra directory level.

glm:	glm-repackage.bat mycoguaarcvs/glm/src mynewcougaar/glm
** again note that it is best to specify glm/src (do the rest of the module separately)
** note that a hand edit is neccessary to compile...
in org/cougaar/glm/ldm/asset/alpprops.def
remove domain in the following line
includedefs=org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/asset/properties.def


scalability: module-repackage.bat mycougaarcvs/scalability mynewcougaar/scalability
*** note a hand edit is neccessary to compile...
in org/cougaar/tools/scalability/scalability/scalability/scalabilityassets.def
remove domain in the following line:
propertydefs = scalabilityprops.def, org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/asset/properties.def

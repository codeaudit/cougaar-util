<title>COUGAAR Metrics Service:  Paths</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2>Metric Paths</h2>
<p>This section discusses the structure of the Metrics Paths and
defines common Paths. 

<p> Metrics read from the 
<A Href="MetricsService.html" Target="Contents">MetricsService</A>
are the values from a real-time model of the status of the Cougaar
Society and system resources. The MetricsService allow access to
<em>formulas</em> in the model. Formulas are relative to a <em>
Scope</em>, which define instances of modeled entries and there
relationship between each other.

<p> Containment is a major relationship which is modeled. Child
scopes inherit all the formulas of its parent. The useful
containment relationship in Cougaar are
<code>Host-&gt;Node-&gt;Agent</code>.
For example, Agents have all the formulas of their hosts, and when
agents moves to a new host the metrics track new hosts values.


<h3> Path Syntax </h3>

<p>A Path is a series of Scopes followed by a Formula. If there is
more than one child Scope of the same type in the parent Scope, then
the child Scope is narrowed by Parameters. Each Scope has a fixed
number of parameters and parameter order is import. The Scope type is used as
the name of the scope. Scope and Formula names are case sensitive. For example:
<pre><code>IpFlow(128.33.15.114,128.33.15.113):CapacityMax</code></pre>
<p>
The separator between Scopes and formulas is the ":" and the separator
between parameters is the ",". But your code you should use the
constant <code>PATH_SEPR</code> defined in interface
<code>org.cougaar.core.qos.metrics.Constants</code>:
<pre><code>"IpFlow(128.33.15.114,128.33.15.113)" +PATH_SEPR+ "CapacityMax"</code></pre>

The following sections will use the convention of writing variable parameter fields in brackets [] for variable parameters; using ":"
as the Path Separator; and "," as the parameter separator.
The syntax is as follows
<pre><code>ScopeType1([parameter1],[parameter2]...):ScopeType2([parameter]):Formula</code></pre>
<p>
The Averaging Period are sometimes hardwired into the Formula name,
(yuck!). The Averaging Periods are: "1SecAvg", "10SecAvg",
"100SecAvg", and "1000SecAvg". This section will use the
convention 1xxxSecAvg to represent the averaging period.
<p>
Also, please use the constants interface in core module
    <code>org.cougaar.core.qos.metrics.Constants</code> whenever
    possible. This will allow compile time detection of errors, when 
    the Metrics Service interface inevitably changes in the future

<h3> Host Scope </h3>

Host Scopes can be accessed at root level and take one parameter which
is the Host address. The Host address can be IP V4 address or the
domain name. Hosts scopes are not contained in other Scopes.

      Second. The formula takes into account the base CPU JIPS, the
      number of CPUs, and the Load Average on the Host <p> </dd>

  <dd>CPU capacity in Java Instructions Per Second. JIPS is
	determined through a benchmark. <p></dd>

</dl>

<h3> Node Scope </h3>
Node Scopes can be accessed at root level and take one parameter which is the
the Node's Message address. The Node is also contained within a Host
Scope and inherits all the Host Scope's formulas.

<p> No additional formulas are defined for Nodes

<h3> Agent Scope </h3>
Agent Scopes can be accessed at root level and take one parameter which is the
the Agent's Message address. The Agent Scope is also contained within a Node
Scope and inherits all the Node Scope's formulas. When an
Agent moves to a new Node, the Agent Scope will be moved the the
corresponding Node, i.e. all the re-wiring is automatic, but may be
slightly delayed due to discovery issues.

<dl>
  <dt> <b><code>Agent([Agent ID]):LastHeard</code> </b></dt>

  can be from any source such as <em>successful</em> communication, acknowledgment, or gossip.<p> </dd>

  <dt> <b><code>Agent([Agent ID]):LastSpoke</code> </b></dt>
  <dd> Seconds since some component attempted to Speak to the
  Agent. The attempt does not have to be successful. For example, if
  a failed  message is retied,  LastSpoke will be the time of last retry <p> </dd>

<title>COUGAAR Metrics Service: Keys</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2>Metric Keys</h2>

<p>This section discusses the structure of the Metrics Keys name-space and
defines common Keys. 

<p>Metrics are written into the 
<A Href="MetricsUpdateService.html" Target="Contents">MetricsUpdateService</A> based on Key-Value
pairs. While the Key itself is just a string, we impose a structure to
help organize the information. Metric keys form a hierarchical name
space that is loosely modeled after SNMP MIBs.  The value is a 
<A Href="Metric.html" Target="Contents">Metric</A>,
record with slots for value, credibility, time-stamp, units, etc. 

<p>At runtime, each Node has a store of Key-Value pairs. When the
MetricsUpdaterService receives a new Key-Value pair, it looks up the
Key in the store. If the value has changed, all the Metrics
Formulas that have subscribed to this Key will be called-back with the
new Value.  The Metrics Service in each Node has one and only one effective Value
for each Key, which is derived through a complicated set of
integration rules based on credibility and timestamps.

<p>Normally, Key-Value pairs are not read from the Metrics Service, but
are only processed by internal formulas. One debugging trick to view
the effective value of a key is to the Path 
<A Href="paths.html" Target="Contents">Integrater</A>, 
which takes a Key as a parameter and returns the effective metric.
Currently, there is no way to list all the Keys available to a Node.

<h3> Key Syntax </h3>

A Metrics Key is a string divided into fields using the Key Separator, e.g.
<pre><code>Host_128.33.15.114_CPU_Jips</code></pre>

<p> The current Key Separators is "_".  But your code you should use the
string constant <code>KEY_SEPR</code> defined in
<code>org.cougaar.core.qos.metrics.Constants</code>:
<pre><code>"Host" +KEY_SEPR+ "128.33.15.114" +KEY_SEPR+ "CPU"
      +KEY_SEPR+ "Jips"</code></pre>

Notice that some of the fields are types (e.g. Host, CPU, Jips) and
others are identifiers (e.g. 128.33.15.114). The types are fixed and
case sensitive. Identifiers are variable and define branches in naming
hierarchy.

<p>In the following section we will use the
convention of writing identifier fields in brackets [], and using "_"
as the Key Separator
<pre><code>Host_[Host IP]_CPU_Jips</code></pre>

<h3> Host </h3>
Host Keys start with identifying the host and then have several
    optional field for different host characteristics. Host identifiers
    are raw IP V4 addresses, not domain names. 
<dl>
  <dt><code><b>Host_[Host IP]_CPU_Jips</b></code></dt>
  <dd>CPU capacity in Java Instructions Per Second. JIPS is
	determined through a benchmark. <p></dd>

  <dt><code><b>Host_[Host IP]_CPU_loadavg</b></code></dt>
  <dd>CPU load average, i.e. the average number of processes that are
	ready to run. <p> </dd>

  <dt><code><b>Host_[Host IP]_CPU_count</b></code></dt>
  <dd> The number of CPUs in this host <p> </dd>

  <dt><code><b>Host_[Host IP]_CPU_cache</b></code></dt>
  <dd> Size of CPU level 2 cache<p> </dd>

  <dt><code><b>Host_[Host IP]_Memory_Physical_Total</b></code></dt>
  <dd> Total Physical Memory<p> </dd>

   <dt><code><b>Host_[Host IP]_Memory_Physical_Free</b></code></dt>
   <dd> Free Physical Memory<p> </dd>

  <dt><code><b>Host_[Host IP]_Network_TCP_sockets_inuse</b></code></dt>
  <dd> TCP sockets in use<p> </dd>

  <dt><code><b>Host_[Host IP]_Network_UDP_sockets_inuse</b></code></dt>
  <dd> UDP sockets in use<p> </dd>


</dl>

<h3> IP Flow </h3>
Network Keys start with identifying the IP Flow and then have several
    optional field for different network characteristics. End-point
    addresses are raw IP V4 addresses and not domain names. 

<dl>
  <dt> <code><b>Ip_Flow_[src IP]_[dst IP]_Capacity_Max</b></code></dt>
  <dd> The maximum bandwidth (kbps)for path across the network, i.e. with no
	competing traffic. <p> </dd>

  <dt> <code><b>Ip_Flow_[src IP]_[dst IP]_Capacity_Unused</b></code></dt>
  <dd> The expected available bandwidth (kbps) for a path across the network,
	i.e. the max minus the competing traffic.<p> </dd>

</dl>

<h3> Site Flow </h3>

Sites are an IP subnetwork which can be represented with a simple mask
(number of bits with leading 1's). Site_Flows between sites can be
used as defaults, instead of specify specific Ip_Flows. For example,
<pre><code>Site_Flow_128.89.0.0/16_128.33.15.0/28_Capacity_Max</code></pre>

<dl>
  <dt><code><b>Site_Flow_[src IP/mask]_[dst IP/mask]_Capacity_Max</b></code>
  </dt>
  <dd> Maximum bandwidth (kbps) between Sites. The current formulas can
	model asymmetric bandwidth between Sites, by publishing
	Site_Flows for both direction. If only one direction is
	published, the formulas will assume the bandwidth is the same
	in both directions. <p> </dd>
</dl>

<h3> Agent </h3>
Agents are identified by their message Id. 

<dl>
  <dt><code><b>Agent_[Message ID]_HeardTime</b></code>
  </dt>
  <dd> System.currentTimeMillis() time-stamp for the last time
	some component has heard from this agent<p> </dd>

  <dt><code><b>Agent_[Message ID]_SpokeTime</b></code>
  </dt>
  <dd> System.currentTimeMillis() time-stamp for the last time
	some component has attempted to speak to this agent<p> </dd>

</dl>

<h3> Node </h3>
Nodes are identified by their message Id. Currently, there are no Node
    specific Keys

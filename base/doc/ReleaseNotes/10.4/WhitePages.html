<h2>Cougaar White Pages</h2>
<p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
The white pages service is the Cougaar naming service for name to
address resolution, similar to DNS's job of resolving host names
to IP addresses.
<p>
Earlier versions of Cougaar (&lt;10.0) used an RMI-based JNDI naming
service.  The current white pages service uses the in-band Cougaar
message transport.
<p>
The current white pages also features DNS-style caching.  Client
entries are leased and periodically renewed to reconcile crashed
servers.
<p>

<h3>Enhancements in 10.4.4:</h3>
<p>
All 10.4.4 enhancements are backwards-compatible with old "alpreg.ini"
and "-Dorg.cougaar.name.server=<i>host:port</i>" configurations dating
back to 9.0.
<p>

<h4>New system properties</h4>
See the properties file ("api/Parameters.html") for a list of all
"org.cougaar.core.wp" system properties.  For example, there are
system properties to reduce white pages message traffic by
changing the default cache expiration time (90 seconds) and
lease expiration time (4 minutes).
<p>

<h4>Performance enhancments</h4>
Various performance enhancements were implemented, such as better
client-side cache prefetching (bug 3069), request message batching,
and new UID-based cache and lease renewal (bug 3082).
<p>

<h4>Explicit server agents</h4>
Added support for explicit White Pages server agents.  In prior
releases the "alpreg.ini" and name server system property only
specified the host and port address, e.g.<pre>
  -Dorg.cougaar.name.server=foo.com:8888
</pre>
If multiple nodes are started on that host then they would race to
become the name server.  In this release the configuration can now
optionally explicitly specify the agent's (or node's) name,
e.g.<pre>
  -Dorg.cougaar.name.server=AgentX@foo.com:8888
</pre>
This allows the user to know precisely which agent is acting as
the server, which is useful for security and debugging purposes.
In future release the explicit approach will likely be required.
For additional configuration details see the javadocs for<pre>
  org.cougaar.core.wp.resolver.ConfigReader
</pre>

<h4>Explicit server plugin</h4>
Related to the above explicit White Pages server option, a new
system property has been added to disable the default load of the
name server in all nodes:<pre>
  -Dorg.cougaar.core.load.wp.server=<i>boolean</i>
</pre>
where the default is the backwards-compatible "true".  If this
is disabled then the server plugin should be added to the ".ini"
file of the agent that will run the server:<pre>
  Node.AgentManager.Agent.WPServer = org.cougaar.core.wp.server.Server
</pre>
The default behavior of loading servers into all nodes is often
wasteful since only the agents specified as servers in the
configuration will be asked to perform white pages server actions.
In future release the explicit approach will likely be required.
<p>

<h4>Agent-based servers</h4>
As suggested above, a white pages server can now be loaded as a
node-agent plugin or as a plugin in a regular agent.  The use of
a regular agent allows a node to host the server agent, crash,
and a new differently-named node on that host to restart the
server agent.
<p>

<h4>Server aliases</h4>
All servers now use unique configuration alias, where the default
alias is "WP".  Other aliases start with "WP-" and end in a number,
e.g. "WP-123".  For example, the configuration can say:<pre>
  -Dorg.cougaar.name.server.WP-123=AgentX@foo.com:8888
</pre>
In an "alpreg.ini" this would look like:<pre>
  WP-123=AgentX@foo.com:8888
</pre>
These aliases are used for server replication, as documented
<a ref="#replication">below.</a>
<p>

<a name="replication">
<h4>Server replication</h4>
Added support for replicated White Pages servers.  Additional servers
are added with aliases and can be explicit agents as noted above,
e.g.:<pre>
  -Dorg.cougaar.name.server.WP=AgentA@host1.com:8888
  -Dorg.cougaar.name.server.WP-2=AgentB@host2.com:8888
  -Dorg.cougaar.name.server.WP-3=AgentC@host3.com:8888
</pre>
Nodes dynamically select servers based upon round-trip-time metrics.
The selection algorithm is documented in:<pre>
  org.cougaar.core.wp.resolver.SelectManager
  org.cougaar.core.wp.resolver.SelectService
</pre>
This balances the clients across the servers and allows the
clients to select alternate servers if their current selection
becomes unresponsive (e.g. due to a crash).  Both clients and
servers set message delivery timeouts to avoid excessive message
transport delivery queuing (bug 3213 and bug 3276).
<p>

<h4>Access control</h4>
A new WhitePagesProtectionService has been added (bug 3183).  By
default there is no implementation, but the white pages client and
server will use the service if it's advertised by a HIGH-level
node-agent component.  The node's white pages client uses the service
to wrap modification (bind/unbind) requests and the server uses the
service to unwrap these requests.  The agent making the request is
specified when wrapping/unwrapping requests.  For example, a
WhitePagesProtectionService implementation could sign all client
requests and the server unwrapping could check the signature and
check a "denied-agents" list before allowing the modification.

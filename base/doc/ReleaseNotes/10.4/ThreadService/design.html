<h2>Design and Architecture</h2>

<p>
The overall structure of the thread service system is a tree that
tends to mimic the tree of Containers in COUGAAR. Each level of this
tree includes its own trio of thread services which are directly
responsible for the Threads used at that level of the hierarchy and
indirectly responsible for its children.

<p> Each level other than the root requests run-rights from its parent
and only runs as many java Threads as it has rights. With the default
scheduler, all requests for run-rights ultimately propogate to the
root service, which keeps a count of running threads and refuses to
allocate further rights if that count hits a given maximum (30 by
default). As each Thread finishes, its run-right is released, again
propagating to the root service. The released right will then be made
available to the children, using a layer-specific algorithm. Each
layer can (a) consume the right itself (if the given layer has queued
threads); (b) recursively give it to a child; or (c) decline to accept
it.

<p> The direct control of local threads at any given level is handled
by a Scheduler. If a thread at that level wants to run, the Scheduler
is asked for a right. If a right is available a true java Thread will
be run; if not, the request will be queued until sufficient rights are
available. The order in which items are removed from the queue depends
on a Comparator, which by default uses time (i.e., fifo) but which at
any time can be replaced by an arbitrarily complex and dynamic
Comparator via the ThreadControlService. Schedulers use a
RightsSelector to determine the possible re-allocation of a released
run-right. The default RightsSelector uses a round-robin algorithm,
which provides fair scheduling between the layer's own queued requests
and its children. The RightsSelector can be replaced at any time via
the ThreadControlService.

<p>The hierarchy skeleton is represented by a set of TreeNodes. The
TreeNode at any given level holds pointers to the level's scheduler,
selector, parent node and child nodes.

<p>Any Container whose components wish to use the thread services
should provide those services locally, using
ThreadServiceProvider. This will ensure that the thread service
hierarchy maps properly into the Component hierarchy.

<h3>Core Internal Classes</h3>

<dl>

<dt>ThreadPool</dt>

<dd>This is an implementation of a classic thread-pool. The threads it
    provides are defined by an inner class, PooledThread.<p>
</dd>

<dt>SchedulableObject</dt>
    
<dd>This is the implementation of Schedulable. It communicates with a
    Scheduler when it wants to request or return rights and with the
    ThreadPool when it needs a Thread.<p>
</dd>

<dt>Scheduler</dt>
    
<dd>
    This is the simplest scheduler class. It deals with run-rights
    locally, completely ignoring the hierarchy. It's also the
    implementation of the ThreadControlService.<p>
</dd>

<dt>PropagatingScheduler</dt>
    
<dd>
    This is an extension of Scheduler that provides the standard
    hierarchical behavior, as described above.<p>
</dd>

<dt>ThreadListenerProxy</dt>

<dd>This is the implementation of ThreadListenerService.<p>
</dd>

<dt>ThreadServiceProxy</dt>

<dd>
    This is the implementation of ThreadService. It creates the
    Thread TreeNode and the thread pool and links the pool to a
    Scheduler.<p>
</dd>

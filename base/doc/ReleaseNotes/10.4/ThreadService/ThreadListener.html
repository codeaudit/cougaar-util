  <dt>
      <code>void threadQueued(Schedulable schedulable, Object
      consumer)
      </code>
  </dt>
      
  <dd>

      Subscribed <code>ThreadListeners</code> at any given level
      will receive this callback when any <code>Schedulable</code>
      is placed on the queue of pending 'threads' for that level.
      The consumer on whose behalf the <code>Schedulable</code> was
      created is also provided.<p>

  <dt>
      <code>void threadDequeued(Schedulable schedulable, Object
      consumer)
      </code>
  </dt>
      
  <dd>

      Subscribed <code>ThreadListeners</code> at any given level
      will receive this callback when any <code>Schedulable</code>
      is popped of the queue of pending 'threads' for that level, in
      preparation for being run.  The consumer on whose behalf the
      <code>Schedulable</code> was created is also provided.<p>
      
  </dd>

  <dt>
      <code>void threadStarted(Schedulable schedulable, Object
      consumer
      </code>
  </dt>
      
  <dd>

      Subscribed <code>ThreadListeners</code> at any given level
      will receive this callback when any <code>Schedulable</code>
      at that level starts running.  The consumer on whose behalf
      the <code>Schedulable</code> was created is also provided.<p>
      
  </dd>

  <dt>
      <code>void threadStopped(Schedulable schedulable, Object
      consumer)
      </code>
  </dt>
      
  <dd>
      
      Subscribed <code>ThreadListeners</code> at any given level
      will receive this callback when any <code>Schedulable</code>
      at that level stops running.  The consumer on whose behalf
      the <code>Schedulable</code> was created is also provided.<p>
      
  </dd>

  <dt>
      <code>void rightGiven(String consumer);</code>
  </dt>
      
  <dd>

      Subscribed <code>ThreadListeners</code> at any given level
      will receive this callback when the next higher Thread
      Services have granted this level a "right" for the given
      thread consumer.  No <code>Schedulable</code> has claimed
      the right at this point so none is passed in the
      callback.<p>
      
  </dd>

  <dt>
      <code>void rightReturned(String consumer)</code>
  </dt>
      
  <dd>

      Subscribed <code>ThreadListeners</code> at any given level
      will receive this callback when that level returns a
      "right" to the next higher level.  The
      <code>Schedulable</code> which used the right is already
      back in the thread pool at this point, so it isn't passed
      in the callback.<p>

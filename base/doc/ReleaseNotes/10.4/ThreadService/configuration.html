<h3>Command-line (-D) Properties</h3>

<dl>

  <dt><b>org.cougaar.thread.running.max</b></dt>

  <dd>Provide an integer as the value of this property to set the
  absolute maximum number of running threads as well as the current
  max and the size of the thread pool (default = 30).  A negative
  value is interpreted to mean that an unlimited number of threads can
  run.  The current max can be altered dynamically via the
  <code>ThreadControlService</code> but can never exceed the value
  given here. <p> </dd>

  <dt><b>org.cougaar.thread.poolsize.initial</b></dt>
  <dd>Provide a positive integer as the value of this property to set
  the number of Java native threads that are instantiated initially in the
  thread pool.
  </dd>

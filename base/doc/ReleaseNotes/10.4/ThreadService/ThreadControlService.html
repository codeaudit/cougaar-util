  <dt>
      <code>void setMaxRunningThreadCount(int count)</code>
  </dt>
      
  <dd>
      Sets the maximum number of <code>Schedulables</code>
      that are allowed to run at any one time (across all
      levels).<p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
      <code>void setQueueComparator(Comparator comparator)</code>
  </dt>
      
  <dd>

      Sets the <code>Comparator</code> used by the queue at this level
      to order its elements (<code>Schedulables</code>).  The
      'smallest' value, as determined by the <code>Comparator</code>,
      is the first element of the queue. By default the queue is
      sorted by time (fifo). <p>
      
  </dd>

  <dt>
      <code>void setRightsSelector(RightsSelector selector)</code>
  </dt>
      
  <dd>
      
      By default, the "right" to run is handled in a round-robin
      fashion.  This can be overridden by providing a different
      <code>RightsSelector</code>.  The rights-selection
      mechanism is experimental and lightly tested, and
      shouldn't be used (yet) except for experimenting.<p>
      
  </dd>

  <dt>
      <a name="disqualification">
      <code>boolean setQualifier(UnaryPredicate predicate)</code>
      </a>
  </dt>
      
  <dd>
      
      Sets the qualifier at this level.  The qualifier is used
      to disqualify queued <code>Schedulables</code> temorarily.
      Any <code>Schedulable</code> on the queue which doesn't
      satisfy the predicate is removed and held in another list.
      Such a <code>Schedulable</code> will only be returned to
      the queue (and thus given the opportunity to run
      eventually) if the qualifier is unset (ie, set to
      <code>null</code>).

      <p> NB: The qualifier can only be set to a
      non-<code>null</code> value if it's current
      <code>null</code> .<p>
      
  </dd>


  <dt>
      <a name="childdisqualification">
      <code>boolean setChildQualifier(UnaryPredicate predicate)</code>
      </a>
  </dt>
      
  <dd>
      
      Sets the qualifier for child schedulers at this level.  The
      qualifier is used to prevent children from gaining rights they
      might otherwise have access to.  This is useful to keep one
      child from using up all its parents rights (for example).

      <p> NB: The qualifier can only be set to a
      non-<code>null</code> value if it's current
      <code>null</code> .<p>
      
  </dd>
      

  <dt>
      <code>int runningThreadCount()</code>
  </dt>
      
  <dd> Returns the number of <code>Schedulables</code> that are
      currently running at this level.<p> </dd>

  <dt>
      <code>int pendingThreadCount()</code>
  </dt>
      
  <dd> Returns the number of <code>Schedulables</code> that are
      currently queued at this level,<p> </dd>

  <dt>
      <code>int activeThreadCount()</code>
  </dt>
      
  <dd> Returns the number of <code>Schedulables</code> that are
      currently either running or queued at this level.<p> </dd>

  <dt>
      <code>int maxRunningThreadCount()</code>
  </dt>
      
  <dd> Returns the maximum number of <code>Schedulables</code>
      that are allowed to run at any one time (across all
      levels).<p> </dd>

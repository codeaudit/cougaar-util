    <title>COUGAAR Thread Services in a Nutshell: SchedulableStatus</title>
  </head>

    <h2>org.cougaar.core.thread.SchedulableStatus</h2>

    <p>The ScheduleStatus class is used to dynamically mark
    when a thread ventures into a blocking region. It is
      preferable to not allow threads to block and to 
      <a href="usecases.html" target="contents">refactor</a>
      your component into a non-blocking form. Sometimes it is not
      possible to refactor out the blocking call. In these cases, the
      region of the code that blocks should be marked when the pooled
      thread enters and leaves the blocking region.

    <p>To help debugging, the blocking regions are displayed as part
    are as part of the TopServlet and the RogueThreadDetector. Since
    the <code>Schedulable</code> is marked with the blocking region,
    Cougaar thread scheduler policies can also use the status to help
    determine which <code> Schedulable </code> to run next or the max
    number of pooled threads.

     <p> The following status types are defined:
     <code>  OTHER, WAIT, FILEIO, NETIO </code> 
    <br> A <code> NOT_BLOCKING</code> type is a negitive number.
    <p>
    <dl>
      <dt> <code>void beginBlocking(int type, String excuse) </code> </dt>
      <dd>
	  Mark the current running <code> Schedulable </code> as
      Blocking, with a given type and excuse. The static method finds
      the <code>Schedulable</code> for the running thread, so you do
      not need to do any bookkeeping your self. This call is cheap and
	  should be used as close to the blocking region as possible
      </dd><p>
      <dt> <code>void beginWait(String excuse) </code> </dt>
      <dd>
	  Sets status type to <code> WAIT</code>
      </dd><p>
      <dt> <code>void beginFileIO(String excuse) </code> </dt>
      <dd>
	  Sets status type to <code>FILEIO</code>
      </dd><p>
      <dt> <code>void beginNetIO(String excuse) </code> </dt>
      <dd>
	  Sets status type to <code> NETIO</code>
      </dd>  <p>    
      <dt> <code>void endBlocking() </code> </dt>
      <dd>
	  Call this method when leaving the blocking region
      </dd>   <p>  
</dl>

<p>Here is an example usage:
<pre><code>
try{
 SchedulableStatus.beginNetIO("RMI reference decode");
 object = RMIRemoteObjectDecoder.decode(ref);
 } catch (Throwable ex) {
   loggingService.error("Can't decode URI " +ref, ex);
 } finally {
  SchedulableStatus.endBlocking();
 }
</code> </pre>

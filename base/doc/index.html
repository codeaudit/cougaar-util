<!-- COUGAAR 9.2 COUGAAR 9.2 COUGAAR 9.2 COUGAAR 9.2 COUGAAR 9.2 -->

<p>
Build 9.2 is a point release along COUGAAR 9.0. 
It includes assorted <a href="#bugs">bug fixes</a> and 
several new infrastructure features, specifically to support
Ultra*Log defense team development for 2002.

<ul>
<li>
JDK version change. Cougaar 9.2 requires JDK 1.4 to compile and run.
<li>
New Packages and Repackaging.
The main change is that core.jar (core.*, planning.*, util.*) is now split
into bootstrap.jar (bootstrap.*), util.jar (util.*, core.component.*) and
core.jar (core.* exluding core.component.*, planning.*).
The Cougaar Developers' Guide includes a picture of the Package Mapping.
<ul>
<li>
For a list of all packages see <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2/Packages92.htm">Packages92.htm</a>.
<li>
For a list of all modules and the packages contained 
in each module see <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2/PackagesToModules92.htm">PackagesToModules92.htm</a>.
</ul>
<li>
The Cougaar Adaptivity Engine has been added which is responsible for setting the 
operating modes of a number of sub-components based on conditions within a component.
For details on this new Cougaar mechanism see the Adaptivity Engine section
of the Cougaar Developer's Guide (CDG) available on the Cougaar website.
<li>
Agent mobility has been redesigned to provide a service-based API and
a blackboard-based "MoveAgent" API, which simplifies plugin usage.  A
response code is now returned to the requestor, indicating the move
status (SUCCESS/FAILURE).  An example servlet is provided to initiate 
agent mobility from a browser. See the CDG for details.
<li>
The Cougaar Communitiy Infrastructure has been added (Community Service API,
Community Blackboard Objects). See the CDG for details on this new mechanism.
</li>
<li>
Domain componentization. 
Starting with Cougaar 9.2, domains will be implemented as org.cougaar.core.components.Components
contained by an org.cougaar.core.DomainManager. This change primarily impacts domain developers
ans is discussed in more detail in the CDG. Interactions with the domains continue to be
provided by the org.cougaar.core.service.DomainService which has not changed.
As a result of the domain componentization, it is now possible to load domains into an agent
through the agent.ini file. LDMDomains.ini continues to specify a common set of domains for the entire
society and command line arguments can be used to specify domains for a given node.
Domains loaded through the agent.ini are only available within that agent.
Agents which communicate with each other should load the same set of domains.
Without a common set of domains cross agent messages will not be correctly interpreted.
</li>
<li>
"Relay" support has been added.  A Relay is a generic interface for a 
blackboard object, plus a logic provider that is always loaded, that 
simplifies inter-agent communication.  This API is now used for
adaptivity engine updates, mobility requests, and policy distribution;
it will likely be used to define other agent-to-agent(s) protocols.  
See the CDG for details.
</li>
<li>
Support for <i> attribute-based message addresses </i> has been added
which allows to specify the recipient(s) of a message based on the attributes
of an agent within the community. See the CDG for details.
</li>
<li>
HealthReport and ManagementAgent. The manager module includes a demo configuration
designed to display a preliminary implementation of the HealthReport functionality.
The configuration expands minitestconfig by adding a Manager. The Manager agent registers
itself as a Manager in NameServer (in the future, the CommunityService should be used instead).
In addition, OplanHealthReportPlugin has been added to each of the other agents which generates
a HealthReport each time an Oplan is added. The HealthReport uses an AttributeBasedAddress
to direct the report to all agents which have registered as Managers. See manager.doc.README.txt
and the CDG for details.
</li>
<li>
NodeAgent implementation.
Starting with Cougaar 9.2, most of the node-level services are implemented
as plugins and other subcomponents of a new object, the NodeAgent. 
This is a real Cougaar agent that has the task of providing node-level 
lifeline and management services to its node. For details, see the
new section in the Cougaar Architecture Document (CAD) and the
documentation on the NodeControlService and the AgentIdentificationService
in the CDG.
</li>
<li>
Logging has been adopted in several sections of the infrastructure, 
in plugins, and some servlets.  The 
<a href="details/Logging.html">logging documentation</a>
has been expanded and now contains better end-user instructions.
</li>
<li>
Anonymous change reports have been added, which allows a plugin to
tell if an object was "publishChange()"'d without specifying a
ChangeReport.  See the CDG for details.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="details/Servlet.html">Servlet server</a> has been upgraded to Tomcat 4.0.
</li>
<li>
Metrics service. Zinky at noon.
<li>
Thread service. Zinky at noon.
</li>
<li> Persistence supports writing snapshots to multiple media using
media-specific plugins. This allows persistence data to be stored 
locally, remotely, redundantly, and in general, robustly.
Persistence parameters can be controlled by the adaptivity engine
through the PersistenceControlPlugin.
<li> <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2/bol_info.txt">BooksOnLine (BOL)</a> lessons 1 and 2 are part of the distribution.</li>
<li> <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2/stoplight_info.txt">Stoplight Chart Usage</a>.</li>
<li> Windows users of the AppServer must include a line in their server properties file
setting the SYSTEMROOT environment variable for database driver support.
See server/data/win-server-sample.props for details.
</li>
<li> Added and fixed <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2/compload_info.txt">ContainmentService and LoadServlet</a>.</li>
</ul>



<!-- COUGAAR 9.1 COUGAAR 9.1 COUGAAR 9.1 COUGAAR 9.1 COUGAAR 9.1 -->

<p>
Build 9.1 is an unstable release of COUGAAR. Essential differences
	    between 9.0 and 9.1 include:
<ul>

<li>
JDK version change.  Cougaar 9.1 (and all future versions) requires
JDK 1.4 to compile and run. As
of the time of this writing, JDK 1.4 is not yet available in final
form so the translation has been done using JDK 1.4 RC builds.
</li>
<li>
JDBC 3.0 drivers are now supported.  org.cougaar.util.DBConnectionPool
	      supports JDBC 3.0 interfaces.  Only this connection pool
	      class has been ported.  Older, broken db connection pool
	      implementations have been dropped.  In particular,
	      org.cougaar.mlm.plugin.LDMConnection and associated
	      classes have been removed, along with LDMQueryPlugin
	      (LDMSQLPlugin is uneffected).
</li>
<li>The GLM Stimulator Servlet, which allows injection of tasks into an agent, as defined in an xml file. 
<br><a href="../../glm/doc/StimulatorServlet.html">Click here for details.</a>
</li>

<p>

</ul>

<!-- COUGAAR 9.0 COUGAAR 9.0 COUGAAR 9.0 COUGAAR 9.0 COUGAAR 9.0 -->

<p>
Build 9.0 is a major release of COUGAAR. Essential differences between
8.8 and 9.0 include:

<ul>
<li>
Repackaging.&nbsp; See <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackage/Cougaar9.0RepackagingDetails.html">repackaging
details and package maps</a>.&nbsp; To repackage your source code use the
<a href="ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackage/README">scripts</a>
in the repackaging directory (doc/ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackage).</li>

<li>
Standardize use of Plugin.&nbsp; Until version 8.4, PlugIn was prefered to Plugin. 
Since then, we have had a mix of uses. In this version, all references to PlugIn have
been expunged. To change PlugIn to Plugin in all your files and
filenames use the <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackage/PlugInToPlugin.pl">PlugInToPlugin.pl</a> script in the repackaging directory (doc/ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackage).</li>

<li>
Servlets:</li>

<br>The Servlet server is now enabled by default (HTTP port 8800) and replaces
the PSP server. During node initialization you will now see this message:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>Starting HTTP server on port: 8800</tt>
<br>All PSP base-classes have been deprecated, and all PSPs must be ported
to Servlets (see bug 1017). The existing PSP server will be removed in
the 9.2 release and will no longer be supported.
<br>Many PSPs and PSP-client-applications have already been ported to use
the new servlet server, including:

<ul>
<li>
"/tasks" <i>(the ported "/alpine/demo/TASKS.PSP", which is used to view
an agent's blackboard)</i></li>

<li>
"/completion" <i>(view task allocation-result statistics)</i></li>

<li>
"/hierarchy" <i>(view agent relationships)</i></li>

<li>
"/load" <i>(merge of "?LOAD" and "PLUGIN_LOADER.PSP")</i>&nbsp;</li>

<li>
all 6 CSMART PSPs</li>

<li>
the Inventory PSP</li>

<li>
both TPFDD/datagrabber PSPs</li>

<li>
the agg-agent PSPs</li>

<li>
the tutorial PSPs</li>
</ul>
See:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="details/Servlet.html">doc/details/Servlet.html</a> for an introduction
to the servlet server, including example servlets and PSP-porting instructions.</li>

<li>
<a href="../webserver/doc/install.html">webserver/doc/install.html</a>
for server configuration options, including optional HTTPS support.</li>

<li>
<a href="details/PortedPSPs.html">doc/details/PortedPSPs.html</a> for a
table of (old-PSP --> new-Servlet)</li>
</ul>

<li>
Enhanced "LoggingService" support for logging within plugins and other
components.  See 
<a href="details/Logging.html">doc/details/Logging.html</a>
for details.</li>

<li>
Basic Training Course Tutorials.&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li>
The basic training course tutorial has been upgraded to include the use
of the new servlet capability which will replace the deprecated PSP capability.
For each of the PSPs in the basic training course, a servlet has been implemented
to provide the identical capability.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The basic course tutorial exercises which use servlets have had their build
scripts, run scripts, and configuration files have been updated to work
effectively with the servlets.</li>

<li>
Bug 850 indicated a problem with using the batch file to run the HanoiNode
tutorial. This has been fixed in version 9.0.</li>
</ul>

<li>
App-Server enhancements to support the Node Manager</li>

<li>
MTS Componentization</li>

<li>
GLSClient and GLSInitServlet replace GLSGUIInitPlugin, GLSRescindPlugin,
and SQLOplanPlugin. Now when starting one of the logistics domain societies,
users must also run GLSInit.[sh|bat] to initiate processing (assuming
that the three latter plugins have been replaced in the configuration by
GLSInitServlet).</li>

<li>
CSMART cleanup: See <a href="../csmart/doc/release-notes.txt">CSMART release
notes</a> for details. Notable highlights include:</li>

<ul>&nbsp;
<li>
Upgraded required Grappa to most recent version 1.2, which includes the
BBN modifications. See <a href="../sys/index.html">required jar file documentation</a></li>

<li>
Upgraded Ant build script to require Ant1.4.1</li>

<li>
Repackaging and code cleanup</li>For a list of currently known/open bugs

<li>
Use core logging service</li>

<li>
Remove PSP support, using Servlets throughout instead, including new GLSInitServlet</li>

<li>
New Servlet Insertion Recipe</li>
</ul>

<li>
TPFDD Viewer added features :&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li>
TPFDD Display status line that shows total items, tons, volume, and time
to create the TPFDD.</li>

<li>
An Export feature on the TPFDD Display that exports the TPFDD data in a
csv format suitable for Excel.&nbsp;</li>

<br>(See the datagrabber/doc/TPFDDViewer-Introduction.html file for more
information on these new features.)</ul>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="organization"></a>Organization of a Release&nbsp;</h2>
The files in an COUGAAR release fall into the following organizational
areas:

<ul>
<li>
"core:" domain independent agent architecture</li>
<li>
"glm:" LDM and Plugins which have a logistics domain focus based on the
ALP program objectives</li>
<li>
"utility:" GSS and Plugin Contracts</li>
<li>
"tools:" scalability and test tools</li>
<li>
"tutorial:" non-logistics sample societies and Plugins</li>

<li>
"server:" centralized society initiation and management for testing, integration
and demonstration</li>
</ul>
The COUGAAR release will contain the following zip files:

<ul>
<li>
cougaar.zip:&nbsp; COUGAAR demo runtime - all built jar files, configs,
data, bin, minimum doc.</li>
<li>
cougaar-support.zip:&nbsp; All non-built supporting .jars (unpacks into
"sys" subdirectory where Bootstrapper will find them).</li>
<li>
cougaar-api.zip:&nbsp; the javadoc for all the main cougaar classes in
one place. unpacks to api/* instead of under doc as in previous releases.</li>
<li>
*-dev.zip:&nbsp; sources, docs (including javadoc) for each "public" module.</li>
<li>
md5sums.txt:&nbsp; md5 checksums of all the zips.</li>
<li>
build.out: output of the build process</li>
</ul>

<b>To install Cougaar</b>:
<br>Go to the cougaar website (<a href="http://www.cougaar.org">www.cougaar.org</a>)
to get the latest windows Cougaar installer which will install Cougaar
as well as a MySQL database.&nbsp; This will allow users to run off of
a local MySQL database rather than accessing an Oracle database located
in Cambridge, MA at BBN Technologies.
<p><b>Note that if you are installing MySQL on linux or unix, you must
instruct the database to translate all table names to lowercase</b> (which
is the default on Windows machines).&nbsp; To do this, you must set the
variable lower_case_table_names=1 by including the line in /etc/my.cnf:
<p>[mysqld]
<br>set-variable&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; lower_case_table_names=1
<p>Alternatively you can follow these instructions.
<br>1. You'll need cougaar.zip and cougaar-support.zip (the first time)
to get a
<br>runnable system.&nbsp; The rest are extras.&nbsp; Furthermore, the
cougaar-support
<br>contents do not change very often.
<p>2. the zips are designed to be unpacked in the same directory, e.g.
on
<br>unix:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir cougaar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd cougaar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unzip /tmp/cougaar.zip
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unzip -o /tmp/cougaar-support.zip
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setenv COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH
`pwd`
<p>Note that $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/bin/Node and setarguments.bat set the
Cougaar start time with the following Node argument:
<br>-Dorg.cougaar.core.cluster.startTime=08/010/2005
<br>This start time is optimal for the Oplan used with the small-135 society.&nbsp;

<h2>
<a NAME="example"></a>Test Harness Example Implementations</h2>
We only maintain society configurations that we are currently using for
testing purposes and for&nbsp; COUGAAR demonstrations. These society configurations
are available in subdirectories under "configs" in the release. To execute
these COUGAAR societies, these nodes can be executed on a single computer
or distributed across multiple computers.&nbsp;
<p>One society, <b><a href="MiniTestConfig.html">minitestconfig</a></b>
will work "out of the box". We intend to expand this test society in subsequent
releases in size and complexity to test new infrastructure features and
to provide reference examples of components component and service design
patterns. Plugin and component developers are encouraged to use <b>minitestconfig</b>
as a starting point for testing their software for compliance with the
latest infrastructure release. Minitestconfig can be run as a multiple
node, multiple host society.&nbsp;
<p>In addition, there is a much larger configuration in
<b>configs/small-135</b>.
The default configuration supports running a relatively small but interesting
two node society distributed across two machines.&nbsp; See the small-135.readme.html
file in the configuration directory for more information.&nbsp;

<a NAME="delivering"></a>Delivering Software Products&nbsp;</h2>
Please see the Integration Information Area that can be found on the <a href="http://www.ultralog.net">UltraLog</a>
web site.
<p>All Plugin software must use the Java system parameter "org.cougaar.install.path"
or the environment variable COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH to find data files, scripts,
and external programs. For example, if your product is "tops," your classes
will be in:&nbsp;
<blockquote>"$COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH\lib\tops.jar"</blockquote>
and your java code could find your data files with:&nbsp;
<dir>
<dl>

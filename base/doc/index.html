  <!-- COUGAAR 10.2 COUGAAR 10.2 COUGAAR 10.2 COUGAAR 10.2 COUGAAR 10.2 -->

<p> <b>Build 10.2</b> is a minor release, including a few new features
and deprecations.
<p>
<ul>
<li>ComponentDevelopers should not try to put runtime data or
configuration files in configs/common. Instead, these files should be
stored in the local module for that Component. Additionally,
configuration files should be kept separate from data files. To
encourage this, the ConfigFinder may now be created with an optional
"module" argument, as in:
<code>ConfigFinder.getInstance("albbn");</code>. This argument refers
to the name of a directory under Cougaar_Install_Path. When supplied,
the ConfigFinder will add 4 directories local to that module to the
front of the search path:
$CIP/$MOD/configs/$CONFIG;$CIP/$MOD/configs;$CIP/$MOD/data/$CONFIG;$CIP/$MOD/data.
See the class JavaDoc for details.</li>
<li>Used the new above methods, and moved CSMART related .q files to
csmart/data/common. The preferred location for recipeQueries.q is now
csmart/data/common, <em>however</em> the old location will still work.</li>
</ul>

  <!-- COUGAAR 10.0 COUGAAR 10.0 COUGAAR 10.0 COUGAAR 10.0 COUGAAR 10.0 -->

<p> <b>Build 10.0</b> is a major release, including significant code
repackaging and cleanup.
<p>
Please see the <a href="ReleaseNotes/10.0/PortingNotes.html">porting notes</a>
for documentation on how to port Cougaar 9.4 code to Cougaar 10.0.
<p>
<ul>
<li> A new <a href="FAQ.html">Cougaar FAQ</a> and 
<a href="ReleaseNotes/10.0/PackageMap.html">Package Map</a>
are now available with the release.
</li>
<li>ClusterIdentifier has been replaced by MessageAddress, and static 
MessageAddress factory methods have been added (bugs 
<a href="https://www.alpine.bbn.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1116">1116</a>,
<a href="https://www.alpine.bbn.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1325">1325</a>,
<a href="https://www.alpine.bbn.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2496">2496</a>).
The included <a href="ReleaseNotes/10.0/PortingNotes.html#fixCID.pl">fixCID</a> script
can be used to help automate the porting of pre-Cougaar-10.0 source code.<br>
As part of this change, the CSMART configuration database has
changed. We recommend reloading your database, following the CSMART
install instructions. You may also update your database in-place,
using the provided update script in
<code>csmart/data/database/scripts/mysql/sql/cluster-id-removal.sql</code>
Finally, at experiment load time, if CSMART still sees a ClusterIdentifier
in a PropertyGroup, it will replace it with a MessageAddress. You will
need to re-save your experiment though.</li>
<li>AspectValues have been refactored to be immutable and support
static factory methods (bugs
<a href="https://www.alpine.bbn.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2430">2430</a>
and
<a href="https://www.alpine.bbn.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2529">2529</a>).
The included <a href="ReleaseNotes/10.0/PortingNotes.html#fixAV.pl">fixAV</a> script
can be used to help automate the porting of pre-Cougaar-10.0 source code.
</li>
<li>The planning domain has been separated from the core and a new
"planning.jar" is now included in the release.  Several classes have been
assigned new package names to better fit into core (org.cougaar.core.*)
or planning (org.cougaar.planning.*).
The included <a href="ReleaseNotes/10.0/PortingNotes.html#core-repackage">core-repackage</a>
script can be used to help automate the porting of pre-Cougaar-10.0 source code.
</li>
<li>As part of the core/planning split, the Cougaar Domain APIs have been
significantly refactored.  Domain developers should see the
<a href="ReleaseNotes/10.0/PortingNotes.html#domains">domain porting notes</a>.
</li>
<li>The use of custom BindingSites has been almost entirely removed (bug
<a href="https://www.alpine.bbn.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1375">1375</a>).
The PluginBindingSite API in particular has been removed, which means
that plugins that extend ComponentPlugin (which extends 
BlackboardClientComponent) must use the plugin's "getAgentIdentifier()"
and "getConfigFinder()" methods instead of casting the binding site.
The included <a href="ReleaseNotes/10.0/PortingNotes.html#fixBindingSite.pl">fixBindingSite</a>
script can be used to help automate the porting of pre-Cougaar-10.0 source code.
</li>
<li>Related to the above BindingSite refactoring, most of the old 
"<i>X</i>Serves<i>Y</I>" interfaces, such as "ClusterServesPlugin"
and "LogPlanServesLogicProvider", have been replaced with equivalent
Service-based APIs.
</li>
<li>The <code>XMLizable</code> marker interface has been removed.
The "/tasks" servlet's XML encoder now assumes that all blackboard
objects can be inspected (via reflection/BeanInfo).  This simplifies
most blackboard data structures, since they were found to universally
implement the default XMLizable behavior.
</li>
<li>PSP support has been removed and officially replaced by servlets
(bug 
<a href="https://www.alpine.bbn.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1017">1017</a>).
All PSPs have been removed (most were already ported to equivalent
servlets).  Most of the MLM-UI code, which depended upon PSPs, was also
removed (<code>org.cougaar.mlm.ui.*</code>) except for the TPFDD data
grabber.</li>
<li>The initial WhitePagesService, which will replace the current
NamingService, has been defined and a JNDI-based implementation has
been implemented.  Please see the Cougaar Developers' Guide for
details.
</li>
<li>The servlet server has been updated to use the new white pages
service instead of the JNDI naming service.  A new "/wp" servlet
(<code>org.cougaar.core.util.WhitePagesServlet</code>) has been added
to view the contents of the white pages.  The built-in "/agents"
servlet has been enhanced to traverse the naming hierarchy instead of
listing all agent names.
</li>
<li>The "/tasks" servlet has been enhanced to use the "/agents"
servlet for its drop-down selection of agent names, a pattern that
will be required for future servlets.  Servlets should no longer use
the "getAllEncodedAgentNames()" utilities, since these will not scale.
</li>
<li>Insertion points for the major components are now defined by
public constants in the appropriate classes. For example, the
insertion point for an Agent is
org.cougaar.core.agent.Agent.INSERTION_POINT (Plugin is
org.cougaar.core.plugin.PluginBase). Use these constants wherever
possible.</li>
<li>Message transport was updated to use new white pages naming
services and topology service. The LinkProtocol API has changed
slightly as a result.</li>
<li>Made multiple CSMART Changes. As usual, see the <a
href="../csmart/doc/release-notes.txt">CSMART Release Notes</a> for
details.
  <ul>
    <li>Removed various obsolete and unused pieces of code. This
    includes the CSMART Domain (change your LDMDomains.ini as
    necessary), the ABC Impacts and society, and the un-used multiple
    trial support.</li>
    <li>Replaced the 'Default Workspace.bin' workspace file with a
    simple XML file.</li>
    <li>Changed to use SimpleAgent by default, rather than
    ClusterImpl, and updated to use MessageAddress instead of
    ClusterIdentifier. Reload your database to match.</li>
  </ul>
<li>Support for dynamic service discovery has been added through the
servicediscovery module. The default society configurations still use 
the static client/provider relationships defined by the CSMART config
database.  If you would like to use dynamic service discovery, see the 
<a href="../servicediscovery/doc/SD-SocietyStartup.html">COUGAAR Service Discovery Installation Guide</a> for details.
</li>
<li>Strawman Scalable YellowPages implementation<br>Cougaar 10.0
introduces a new naming facility which is essentially an
in-band web-services (UDDI) hierarchical registry.  The initial
implementation is discussed in <a href="../yp/doc/yp.txt">yp/doc/yp.txt</a>.
Note that two third-party packages which are prerequisites have
been slightly modified to support cougaar use.  You can find
patchfiles for both in <a href="ReleaseNotes/10.0/">ReleaseNotes/10.0</a> 
as uddi4j2_0-cougaar10_0.patch and soapuddi0_3_1-cougaar10_0.patch.
</li>
</li>
<li>A list of the hard-coded components that are loaded in all agents
and node-agents has been documented in
<a href="details/DefaultComponents.html"
>doc/details/DefaultComponents.html</a>, as part of bug
<a href="https://www.alpine.bbn.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2522">2522</a>.
</li>
<li>
Embedded Cougaar prototype: The minimum set of Cougaar jars and
files has been dramatically reduced in 10.0. Cougaar 10.0
can run with a minimum code foot print of 2.1MB,
down from 10.7MB for Cougaar 9.6.
The minimum jars and files are:(/lib/core.jar /lib/util.jar
/lib/javaiopatch.jar /lib/bootstrap.jar /sys/log4j.jar /core/bin/Node)
<br>The following services can now be disabled:
<ul>
  <li>Planning: -Dorg.cougaar.core.load.planning=false (default=true)</li>
  <li>Servlets: -Dorg.cougaar.core.load.servlet=false  (default=true)</li>
  <li>Communities: -Dorg.cougaar.core.load.community=false (default=true)</li>
  <li>Metric Service: remove the lib/qos.jar and sys/quoSumo.jar </li>
</ul>
Note Embedded Cougaar is just a reduction in the Cougaar 10.0
footprint and is NOT Cougaar ME (Micro Edition), which uses a
different code-base and restricted Java VM.
</li>
<li><a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/intro.html">Concurrent.jar</a> added to the standard jar set.  This is Doug Lea's 
excellent threading and synchronization package which forms the basis
of <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/concurrent/dist/docs/index.html">JSR-166</a>.
</li>
<li>
Metric Service has been componentized.  The
    metrics service property file is no-longer necessary, i.e. the
    configuration can be specified, via CSMART or .ini files. (see
    Cougaar Developers' Guide) The
    <code>-Dorg.cougaar.metrics.properties</code> flag is still supported, but
    deprecated. 
</li>
  
</ul>

  <!-- COUGAAR 9.6 COUGAAR 9.6 COUGAAR 9.6 COUGAAR 9.6 COUGAAR 9.6 -->

<p> <b>Build 9.6</b> is a snapshot of the final state of the 9.4
branch of cougaar development.  There are no new features since
9.4.1.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Many bugs fixed.  See 
<a href="ReleaseNotes/9.6/ClosedBugs941-96.htm">ClosedBugs941-96.htm</a> for a list.
</li>
<li>A snapshot of the Adaptive Logistics codebase developed under the
Ultra*Log program has been merged in.
</li>
</ul>

  <!-- COUGAAR 9.4.1 COUGAAR 9.4.1 COUGAAR 9.4.1 COUGAAR 9.4.1 COUGAAR 9.4.1 -->
 
<p> <b>Build 9.4.1</b> is an incremental patch release of Cougaar 9.4.1 intended 
to address known issues in 9.4.0 and add required functionality for the Ultra*Log
Fall 2002 integration. Note in particular the entirely new database
and supported sample logistics Plugins. This release is intended to provide the baseline for the Ultra*Log integration activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Several database changes have been made.  Domain data has been expanded for 
several organizations.  Extranneous v4_/v6_ prefixes have been removed.  It is
necessary to reload all components of the database, including
1ADDomainData.sql (which you get by unzipping 1ADDomainData.zip and
which replaces mysqldump.txt or mysqldump.9.2.txt in dbms/data/mysql) and 
Domain-MySQL.ZIP as well as re-run the load scripts that load the .csv files.  
See <a href="../csmart/doc/InstallAndTest.html">the CSMART Install
instructions</a>.  
For any previous exports of the database, 
it is necessary to run the v4_v6_conversion.[bat/sh] script on them before 
importing.
</li>
<li>The small-135 configuration is no longer supported. While it is
still available in configs/examples/small-135, we no longer guarantee
that the referenced Plugins run correctly. It may still be useful for
some testing, or as an example of a large ini based
configuration. However, users are directed towards CSMART and the
included large 1AD configurations, which are similar.</li>
<li>As part of the significant database changes, the basic military
logistics Plugins included with the Cougaar release have been greatly
modified and improved, as part of the Ultra*Log program. These new
plugins are available in two new modules, albbn and alsra.</li>
<li> 
For a list of new/changed Adaptive Logistics Plugins, see <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.4.1/ALSubstitutionRules.htm">ALSubstitutionRules</a>.
</li>
<li>Also as part of the change to the new Adaptive Logistics Plugins,
note that the sample AppServer server.props files have changed, to
reflect the new location for some GLMTrans config files. Users of the
1AD society should update their local server.props files appropriately.</li>
<li>A new version (6.0) of JCChart is included.  The file name is now just
jcchart.jar instead of jcchart451K.jar.  There were no code changes
required to support the new version, which fixes a number of bugs.</li>
 <li> A new optional bootstrapper class may be used to check the jars found 
by the Bootstrapper for consistency.  This is not the default because of
the extra time it takes.  To enable, set
<em>-Dorg.cougaar.bootstrap.class=org.cougaar.bootstrap.CheckingBootstrapper</em> 
Note that since this is implemented as a separate bootstrapper, it (for
instance) cannot be used with NAI's secure bootstrapper package.</li>

<li>The <tt>org.cougaar.core.persist.NonPersistable</tt> interface
has been removed. This interface existed (in various packages) since an early
implementation of persistence (over four years ago). It managed to survive
through succeeding development despite that fact that it did nothing. Because
it was attracting the attention of developers and being used (and failing
to do what was expected), we decided to to remove it. This uncovered additional,
non-functioning, uses. Use the <tt>org.cougaar.core.persist.NotPersistable</tt>
 interface to mark classes whose instances should <i>not</i> be saved in
persistence snapshots. </li>
<li>A new sample Logging service properties file is now provided,
under doc/details/sample-logging.props</li>
<li> The AppServer now supports dynamic add and remove of output listeners for running nodes (Bug 1341). This has been integrated into CSMART as noted below.
<li>There have been numerous CSMART usability and feature
enhancements. As always, for the latest changes, see the <a href="../csmart/doc/release-notes.txt">CSMART
Release Notes</a>. However, highlights include:
      <ul>
        <li>Database changes to support new logistics Plugins - reload
        your database entirely.</li>
	<li>Updated ER/Studio diagrams of CSMART configuration
	database available.</li>
	<li>Fixes to Agent Insertion Recipes.</li>
	<li>New Complete Agent recipe to specify a new Agent along
	with all its contents in one easy-to-build recipe.</li>
	<li>New Component Collection recipe that allows specifying an
	arbitrary collection of components to add all with one recipe
	(for example, all the new components required for security
	management, including Agents and Plugins, could be added with
	one recipe.)</li>
	<li>Multiple recipes added to the defaults to support mobility
	and communities.</li>
	<li>Several pre-configured recipes added to the database to
	support logistics adaptivity and OPLAN editing.</li>
	<li>Adaptivity recipe now supports one plays file for all
	Agents.</li>
	<li>Community definitions can be imported from a
	communities.xml file, and exported when dumping INIs.</li>
	<li>Enhanced visibility into Node and Agent contents from the
	Experiment Builder pop-up menus.</li>
	<li>Significant changes to CSMART's interaction with the
	Application Server. CSMART can now "attach to" (monitor, then
	even kill and restart) new Nodes that may
	start up during a run. You can stop CSMART without killing the
	society. Multiple instances of CSMART can "attach to" the same society.</li>
      </ul>
</li> 
<li> 

The Message Transport Service API has a new method
<i>getAgentState()</i>.  The flush aspect has been removed, replaced by
a new simplified implementation in the base infrastructure.
Externally interesting MTS components -- Aspects, LinkProtocols, and
SelectionPolicies -- can now be loaded via CSMART recipes.  For more
details on these topics, see <a href=ReleaseNotes/9.4.1/MTS.html>MTS
Release Notes</a>

</li>


<li>


The performance of the Metrics services have been enhanced and new
sensors and display Servlets have been added. See <a
href=ReleaseNotes/9.4.1/MetricsServices.html>Metrics Services Release
Notes</a> for more details.

</li>


<li>

The Thread service is now fully componentized, allowing thread
services to be loaded with ComponentDescriptions. Also Agent CPU Load
sensors were added to measure the CPU consumption of Agents and
publish the results to the metric service.

</li> 

<li> The Agent Mobility API has been enhanced to support "add" and "remove" of agents. This replaces the ComponentMessage API.
<li> Several Agent Mobility bugs have been fixed:
<ul>
<li> Bug 1316 "before Context" fixed, i.e., message delivery to moving agents now retries correctly.
<li> Bug 1630 "agent move with undelivered messages" fixed, i.e., unsent messages are now captured as part of the agent state and resent after the agent has moved.
</ul>
</li>

<li>
A utility class <a href="api/org/cougaar/util/CougaarEvent.html">
org.cougaar.util.CougaarEvent</a> has been added to make it simpler for
Defense Thread code to communicate with the experiment controller
software.
</li> 
</ul>

  <!-- COUGAAR 9.4.0 COUGAAR 9.4.0 COUGAAR 9.4.0 COUGAAR 9.4.0 COUGAAR 9.4.0 --> 
<p> <b>Build 9.4</b> is a significant release of Cougaar 9 intended to add 
additional functionality and address known issues in 9.2, as well as include
enhancements developed as part of the Ultra*Log integration. </p>
      <ul>
 <li> The standard initializer service implementations will no longer construct 
ComponentDescription with empty lists when no parameter list is given.  Component.setParameter
will be called IFF  the .ini file or CSMART database actually specifies arguments.
 The implication is that Components should not put initialization code in 
the setParameter method if the Component ever is constructed without parameters. 
        </li>
 <li> New documentation has been added that summarizes <a href="details/PersistenceGuidelines.html">
persistence and agent mobility</a>.   In particular, the document covers:
      <ul>
        <li>Basic definitions for "persistence, mobility,
 	    reconciliation, rehydration", etc.</li>
 	<li>Requirements for Cougaar software (plugins, components,
	services, and agents) to fully support persistence, restarts,
	and agent mobility.</li>
        <li>Failure symptoms if persistence or mobility is not
         correctly supported, and how developers can track down and fix these
         bugs.</li>
        <li>Tests and expected results.  The tests include JVM-kills
        and the use of agent mobility to both move and restart
        agents.</li>
         <li>Detailed notes on how lazy persistence and reconciliation
   work, which will help clear up the mysterious behavior you might see.</li>
       </ul>
 </li>
 <li> The LoggingService is available earlier (during NodeAgent's HIGH subcomponent
pass).  Furthermore, there is a new class <a href="api/org/cougaar/util/log/Logging.html">
org.cougaar.util.log.Logging</a> which provides a variety of static
methods giving access to loggers and allowing the set up of
thread-specific logging contexts.  Plugins and most components are
still encouraged to use the existing <a href="api/org/cougaar/core/service/LoggingService.html"> 
LoggingService</a>. </li>
 <li> Several agent mobility bugs have been fixed:
          <ul>
   <li>Bug 1218: Move to an unknown node now fails quickly instead of  	
             waiting forever</li>
   <li>Bug 1316: Work around for "before Context" bug, the full fix is 	
             planned for 9.4.1</li>
   <li>Bug 1368: MTS "FlushAspect" warning is no longer generated</li>
   <li>Bug 1369: Fixed race condition between loading and mobility, 	   
          and prevent simultaneous move requests</li>
   <li>Bug 1382: Don't do state reconciliation when moving agents</li>
   <li>Bug 1423: Agent binders now support state capture</li>
   <li>Bug 1549: Fixed memory leak in community services</li> 
          </ul>
 </li>ys, for the latest changes, see the <a href="../csmart/doc/release-notes.txt">CSMART
Release Notes</a>. However, highlights include:
 <li>Minor fix to support running TPFDD Viewer. Avoids necessity for workaround
described in 9.2.2 - errata.</li>
 <li>CSMART configuration database has changed slightly. You should re-load
your configuration database to get the latest functionality, in particular
Community construction and initialization.</li>
 <li>The domain database (ie mysqldump.9.2.txt) now includes additional data,
and should also be re-loaded.</li>
 <li>CSMART now includes an interface for editing Community information.
Separate community configurations are available for each CSMART Experiment.
This new tool is available from the "Communities" pane in the CSMART Experiment
Builder.</li>
 <li>CSMART includes numerous usability and bug fixes, all described in detail
in the CSMART <a href="../csmart/doc/release-notes.txt">release notes</a>
.</li>
 <li>CSMART bug fixes include several to address items in the errata for
9.2.2, including: <br>
          <ul>
 <li>Add Dos Recipe export scripts</li>
 <li>Minor fix to allow seeing non-Plugin Agent contents in Console Node
Info window.</li>
 <li>Avoid some NPEs. See the CSMART release <a href="../csmart/doc/release-notes.txt">
notes</a>
 for details.</li>
 <li>Allow arbitrary insertion points in Specific Insertion recipes. This
solves bug 1387 mentioned in the errata document.</li> 
          </ul>
        </li>
 <li>The Community and Mobility Domains are now included by default, using
the LDMDomains.ini file, and need not be included specially. In addition, 
CSMART 1AD societies (from the CSMART database) include the Community Plugin
in all domain Agents. However, if you wish to use Communities from a Node
Agent, or add new Agents, you must still include the Community Plugin via
a recipe. The required Mobility components are automatically included via
the default CSMART recipes included in a 1AD society.</li>
 <li>Community configuration can now be loaded from either the configuation 
database through CSMART or through an xml file (communities.xml).  See community/doc/README.
 A system property org.cougaar.community.configfile="filename" can be used
to specify a particular community configuration xml file.</li>
 <li>Caching of community information at the CommunityService level has been 
implemented and is enabled by default.  Caching may be turned off by setting
the system parameter org.cougaar.community.caching="off"</li>
 <li> The Bootstrapper now, by default, uses XURLClassLoader rather than BootstrapClassLoader.
 XURLClassLoader is pretty much identical to  URLClassLoader except without
the same serialization/RMI implications. Unlike BootstrapClassLoader, XURLClassLoader
implements the recommended method of extending ClassLoaders (e.g. by extending 
findClass rather than loadClass).  This change brings Cougaar into closer
compliance to standard java applications.  The most significant implication
of this change is that CLASSPATH should include no Cougaar jars other than
bootstrap.jar when using the bootstrapper - failure to follow this rule will
result is various java reflection failures, due to mismatches between the
system classloader and the application one. this change implements RFE 1434
(bug 1434) and fixes bug 1413. The old behavior can be invoked by specifying 
          <em>-Dorg.cougaar.bootstrap.classloader.class=org.cougaar.bootstrap.BootstrapClassLoader</em>
 on the java command line. </li>
 <li> AEViewer servlet now uses introspection to determine the type of OperatingMode.
It should be possible to use the servlet to set the value of any OM that
has a String constructor.  </li>
 <li> The objects listed in the AEViewer servlet are now sorted  alphabetically
 (enhancement bug 1490) </li>
  <li> The Thread service Scheduler has been significantly rewritten and greatly
simplified.  It now limits Java thread usage much more strictly and reliably. 
        </li>
  <li> The MTS will now drop messages if particular classes of Exception
are thrown during serialization or deserialization.  For this release the 
relevant exception classes are GeneralSecurityException and NotSerializableException. </li>
  <li> The Metrics Services are better coupled with the RSS.  Several example 
uses, including servlets and plugins, have been provided (see  <a
href="details/MetricServiceRuntimeNotes.html">MetricServiceRuntimeNotes</a>). </li> 
      </ul>

      <p> <b>Build 9.2.2</b> is a patch release of 9.2 intended to address known
issues in 9.2.1. </p>
      <ul>
 <li>Message Transport Service: 
          <ul>
 <li>Removed a redundant API on the Registery interface for looking up  
  the node's address. The NameSupport.getNodeMessageAddress() should    
be used instead.</li>
 <li>If a client requests the MessageTransportService and is not a     MessageTransportClient,
the service provider will now throw an     IllegalArgumentException instead
of returning Null. </li>
 
          </ul>
 </li>
        <li>Thread Service:<br>
 Thread service now returns a Schedulable instead of a     Thread. Schedulables
are thread proxies from the user's perspective     (things which can be started).
 From the system perspective the     implementation class is the bridge between
Schedulers and lava     Threads.  Java Threads are only associated with Schedulables
as needed     (i.e. when the Scheduler allows the Schedulable to run).<br>
     Version 9.4 will include extensive changes to and simplifications  
  of the thread services.</li>
 <li>Topology Service: QoSMonitorService was removed and replaced with the
topology service.</li>
 <li> New service org.cougaar.core.service.BlackboardQueryService is a form
of very simple but very limited blackboard access for clients which need only
non-transactional, read-only and relatively occasional blackboard queries.
 See <a href="api/org/cougaar/core/service/BlackboardQueryService.html"> api/org/cougaar/core/service/BlackboardQueryService.html</a>
 and <a href="https://www.alpine.bbn.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1140"> bugzilla
bug 1140</a>
 for more information. </li>
 <li>New CSMART Topology view allows monitoring mobile agents and the complete
current society topology.</li>
 <li>CSMART now support specifying variable component load priority.</li>
 <li>There have been multiple CSMART bug fixes. See the  <a href="../csmart/doc/release-notes.txt">
CSMART release notes</a>
 for details.</li>
 <li>The included MySQL JDBC Driver has been upgraded to version 2.0.14.
Changes include bug fixes with Timestamps and performance improvements. Be
sure to re-install 3rd party jars from cougaar-support.zip</li>
 <li>Bug 1313, "Separate topology from MTS" Created new "TopologyReaderService"
for components to list all agents, hosts,  nodes, find out which host an
agent is on, etc.  This simplifies the MTS and  allows for future agent mobility
enhancements.</li>
 <li>Bug 1073, "Servlet-loader should pass servlet as the service-requestor" 
Servlets now use the "BlackboardQueryService", which allows better servlet
 security binding.  Servlets must now use a "setSimpleServletSupport(..)"
 method instead of a "<classname>(SimpleServletSuport ..)" constructor.</classname></li>
 <li>Bug 1290, "Tomcat needs to read from the server.xml for which SSLServer" 
Created new system properties for setting the web-server socket factories.
  This will be used for NAI custom SSL server configuration.</li>
 <li>Bug 1291, "Tomcat SSL should not throw exception when keystore environm" 
Related to bug 1291, which allows a custom socket factory to configure the
 keystore.</li>
 <li>Bug 1163, "Agent Identity Service" Integrated new agent crypto identity
service into agent and node, and  modified the agent to transfer this identity
when the agent moves.  The  default built-in service provider implementation
does nothing and can be  overridden by a HIGH-priority component specified
in the node ".ini"  configuration.</li>
 <li>Bug 1358, "Topology manager does not support MTS message address" Created
new "system" category in the topology service, and modified the MTS  to register
itself with this category.</li>
 <li>Bug 1380, "CSMART topology display must show hostname instead of IP
add" Modified topology services to use the host's name instead of IP address.
        </li>

   <!-- COUGAAR 9.2.1 COUGAAR 9.2.1 COUGAAR 9.2.1 COUGAAR 9.2.1 COUGAAR 9.2.1 -->
  
      <p> <b>Build 9.2.1</b> is a patch release of 9.2 intended to address known
issues in 9.2, and further stabilize a few of the APIs. APIs that have changed
include: BlackboardService (and therefore PluginAdapter);  ThreadService;
CommunityService.  </p>
      <ul>
 <li>The AggAgent should be run in a node using  the  JDK Hotspot Server
VM (-server flag). On some windows systems this requires modifying the System
path such that JDK/bin/java is found before any JRE version of java. Use
of the server VM appears to avoid one known bug VM bug (see <a href="https://www.alpine.bbn.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1252">
 bugzilla bug 1252</a>
) but may slow down general execution speed and exposes another VM bug (see
          <a href="https://www.alpine.bbn.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1322">
 bugzilla bug 1322</a>
). </li>
 <li>The <em>javaiopatch.jar</em> file is now always required in the JVM
bootclasspath.  This was added to support Agent Mobility even if Persistence
is disabled.  Node startup scripts have been updated to match. Users may need
to update their AppServer properties files to match. See the samples in ../server/data
for details.</li>
 <li>Add new Environment variable / -D argument: COUGAAR_WORKSPACE / org.cougaar.workspace.
This directory, which defaults to CIP/workspace, is where all runtime components
should do all file output. This includes persistence. Future releases may
restrict output to this area.</li>
 <li>Most known issues in CSMART have been addressed, including performance
issues and problems with the Society Monitor and Agent Insertion Recipe.
See the  <a href="../csmart/doc/release-notes.txt">CSMART release notes</a>
  for further details.</li>
 <li>A new servlet has been added : the Completion Watcher Servlet.  It measures
execution time of an agent.  For more information, see the  <a href="../glm/doc/CompletionWatcherServlet.html">
Completion Watcher Servlet User's Guide</a>
  for further details.</li>
 <li>The AEViewerServlet has been added. It shows the values of basic  adaptivity
objects, i.e., Conditions, OperatingModes, and OperatingModePolicies. Users
can edit OperatingModePolicies and set the values of OperatingModes with this
servlet.</li>
 <li>The OperatingModePolicyManager has been altered to set the OperatingModes 
referred to in non-adaptive OperatingModePolicies directly, without using
the AdaptivityEngine. Non-adaptive OperatingModePolicies are defined as ones
that have a TRUE ifCondition and instruct OperatingModes to have a single
point range value.</li>
 <li> The Bootstrapper has be refactored to allow clean and flexible extensions,
particularly for the use by a high security bootstrap mechanism.  The various
calling scripts have been cleaned up, and bootstrap.jar is now an executable
jar file. The system property org.cougaar.useBootstrapper is now deprecated:
users should execute Bootstrapper directly or use classpath rather than trying
to have it both ways.  See  <a href="api/org/cougaar/bootstrap/Bootstrapper.html">
api/org/cougaar/bootstrap/Bootstrapper.html</a>
  (if cougaar-api.zip has been installed) for details. </li>
 <li>Added support for component removal through both the AgentContainment
Service and the <em>/load</em> Servlet.  </li>
        <li> Standard Cougaar components now support a number of load-time 
priorities which allow externally-specified components to be loaded in various
ways interspersed with "built in" components of a container.  See <a href="api/org/cougaar/core/component/ComponentDescription.html">
ComponentDescription</a>
  for discussion of the priorities, <a href="api/org/cougaar/core/component/ContainerSupport.html">
ContainerSupport</a>
  for information on how the standard Container implementation interprets
this information, and  <a href="api/org/cougaar/core/node/INIParser.html">
INIParser</a>
  for a discussion of the <em>.ini</em> file extensions which allow this information
to be specified. CSMART does not yet support this mechanism - until it does,
all CSMART-specified components will always be loaded at COMPONENT-level
priority.  This functionality is fully implemented in 9.2.1 for Plugins,
and Agent Components (including NodeAgent). </li>
        <li> The Thread Service API has changed, see <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2.1/threadservice_info.txt">
ThreadService Changes</a>
. </li>
        <li> As of 9.2.1, Cougaar now provides more fine-grained control
 over the externalization of AttributedMessages. In particular, a new set
of  join points has been defined in the interfaces MessageWriter and  MessageReader.
Attaching Aspect delegates at these interfaces provides the  ability to control
and/or monitor  <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2.1/MessageExternalizationAspects.htm">
message externalization</a>
. </li>
        <li>Configuration database has been updated to have only lowercase
table names in all database dump files and q files. Unused configuration
database tables have been removed. </li>
        <li>Enhanced community support. This includes: 
          <ul>
 <li>Support for Attribute Based Address messaging is now provided and used
for  CommunityChangeNotifications. </li>
            <li>The CommunityServiceAPI has been updated to provide support
for Attribute Based Addressing. </li>
            <li>Community configuration is now loaded into a communities
context in the yellow pages from two new database tables in the configuration
database instead of from a xml file. </li>
            <li>SpokesAgentDescriptor and SpokesagentList classes have been
removed. </li>
            <li>See the  <a href="../community/doc/README">Community Readme
File</a>
  describing how to acess community components. </li>
          </ul>
 </li>
        <li>New Blackboard Timestamp capabilities have been added: 
          <ul>
 <li>An envelope-level timestamp subscription that allows a plugin to monitor 
the start and end time of blackboard transactions. </li>
            <li>A new subscription type that captures the creation and modification
times for blackboard objects, and its service-based API (BlackboardTimestampService). 
            </li>
          </ul>
 </li>
        <li>The servlet server now returns an improved error code if the
user requests an unknown servlet path (also addresses Bugs 1242, 1298). </li>
      </ul>
   <!-- COUGAAR 9.2 COUGAAR 9.2 COUGAAR 9.2 COUGAAR 9.2 COUGAAR 9.2 -->  
      <p> <b>Build 9.2</b> is a point release along Cougaar 9.0.  It includes assorted
      <a href="#bugs">bug fixes</a>
 and  several new infrastructure features, specifically to support Ultra*Log
defense team development for 2002.  </p>
      <ul>
 <li> JDK version change. Cougaar 9.2 requires JDK 1.4 to compile and run. 
        </li>
        <li> New Packages and Repackaging. The main change is that core.jar
(core.*, planning.*, util.*) is now split into bootstrap.jar (bootstrap.*),
util.jar (util.*, core.component.*) and core.jar (core.* exluding core.component.*,
planning.*). The Cougaar Developers' Guide includes a picture of the Package
Mapping. 
          <ul>
 <li> For a list of all packages see <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2/Packages92.htm">
Packages92.htm</a>
. </li>
            <li> For a list of all modules and the packages contained  in
each module see <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2/PackagesToModules92.htm">PackagesToModules92.htm</a>
. </li>
          </ul>
 </li>
        <li> The Cougaar Adaptivity Engine has been added which is responsible
for setting the  operating modes of a number of sub-components based on conditions
within a component. For details on this new Cougaar mechanism see the Adaptivity
Engine section of the Cougaar Developer's Guide (CDG) available on the Cougaar
website. </li>
        <li> Agent mobility has been redesigned to provide a service-based
API and a blackboard-based "MoveAgent" API, which simplifies plugin usage.
 A response code is now returned to the requestor, indicating the move status
(SUCCESS/FAILURE).  An example servlet is provided to initiate  agent mobility
from a browser. See the CDG for details. </li>
        <li> The Cougaar Communitiy Infrastructure has been added (Community
Service API, Community Blackboard Objects). See the CDG for details on this
new mechanism. </li>
 <li> Domain componentization.  Starting with Cougaar 9.2, domains will be
implemented as org.cougaar.core.components.Components contained by an org.cougaar.core.DomainManager.
This change primarily impacts domain developers ans is discussed in more
detail in the CDG. Interactions with the domains continue to be provided
by the org.cougaar.core.service.DomainService which has not changed. As a
result of the domain componentization, it is now possible to load domains
into an agent through the agent.ini file. LDMDomains.ini continues to specify
a common set of domains for the entire society and command line arguments
can be used to specify domains for a given node. Domains loaded through the
agent.ini are only available within that agent. Agents which communicate
with each other should load the same set of domains. Without a common set
of domains cross agent messages will not be correctly interpreted. </li>
 <li> "Relay" support has been added.  A Relay is a generic interface for
a  blackboard object, plus a logic provider that is always loaded, that  simplifies
inter-agent communication.  This API is now used for adaptivity engine updates,
mobility requests, and policy distribution; it will likely be used to define
other agent-to-agent(s) protocols.   See the CDG for details. </li>
 <li> Support for <i> attribute-based message addresses </i> has been added 
which allows to specify the recipient(s) of a message based on the attributes 
of an agent within the community. See the CDG for details. </li>
 <li> HealthReport and ManagementAgent. The manager module includes a demo
configuration designed to display a preliminary implementation of the HealthReport
functionality. The configuration expands minitestconfig by adding a Manager.
The Manager agent registers itself as a Manager in NameServer (in the future,
the CommunityService should be used instead). In addition, OplanHealthReportPlugin
has been added to each of the other agents which generates a HealthReport
each time an Oplan is added. The HealthReport uses an AttributeBasedAddress 
to direct the report to all agents which have registered as Managers. See
manager.doc.README.txt and the CDG for details. </li>
 <li> NodeAgent implementation. Starting with Cougaar 9.2, most of the node-level
services are implemented as plugins and other subcomponents of a new object,
the NodeAgent.  This is a real Cougaar agent that has the task of providing
node-level  lifeline and management services to its node. For details, see
the new section in the Cougaar Architecture Document (CAD) and the documentation
on the NodeControlService and the AgentIdentificationService in the CDG. </li>
 <li> Logging has been adopted in several sections of the infrastructure,
 in plugins, and some servlets.  The  <a href="details/Logging.html">logging
documentation</a>
 has been expanded and now contains better end-user instructions. </li>
 <li> Anonymous change reports have been added, which allows a plugin to tell
if an object was "publishChange()"'d without specifying a ChangeReport. 
See the CDG for details. </li>
 <li> The <a href="details/Servlet.html">Servlet server</a>
 has been upgraded to Tomcat 4.0. </li>
 <li> Metrics Service supports integrating multiple raw sensors into a coherent 
view of the Cougaar society which can be accessed by any component in the 
nodes' containment hierarchy. Note that the definitions for the paths (reader
access) and keys (writer access) will evolve in future releases. 
          <ul>
 <li> The MetricsService allows to read integrated metric values in real
time.</li>
 <li> The MetricsUpdateService allows to publish raw metrics into the service.</li>
 
          </ul>
 An example is given in the MetricsTestAspect in the MTS package. For further
details, see the CDG.</li>
 <li> A reusable Thread Service is now available at all levels of the Cougaar
containment hierarchy. In the future, this thread service will be integrated
into the alarms and plugin dispatcher which should be transparent. Component
should not "new" threads and timers, but should use the thread service.  For
more details, see the CDG. </li>
 <li> The Message Transport has added several features which allow aspects
to be combined with fewer conflicts. Some of these features include return
codes, using attribute-based message instead of envelopes, and complete componentization
of aspects and link protocols. </li>
 <li> Persistence supports writing snapshots to multiple media using media-specific
plugins. This allows persistence data to be stored  locally, remotely, redundantly,
and in general, robustly. Persistence parameters can be controlled by the
adaptivity engine through the PersistenceControlPlugin. </li>
        <li> <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2/bol_info.txt">BooksOnLine (BOL)</a>
 lessons 1 and 2 are part of the distribution.</li>
 <li> <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2/stoplight_info.txt">Stoplight Chart Usage</a>
.</li>
 <li> Windows users of the AppServer must include a line in their server
properties file setting the SYSTEMROOT environment variable for database
driver support. See server/data/win-server-sample.props for details. </li>
 <li> Added and fixed <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2/compload_info.txt">ContainmentService
and LoadServlet</a>
.</li>
 <li><a href="../csmart/doc/index.html">CSMART</a>
 now supports running arbitrary Cougaar societies, not just those in the
CSMART configuration database. All Cougaar developers can now use CSMART
to configure, control, and monitor their societies. You may now create a
CSMART "experiment" by loading the definition from old-style INI files (allowing
you to run all tutorial examples, minitestconfig, etc), or by creating it
directly from the CSMART User Interface.</li>
 <li>CSMART also includes support for adding components to a Node Agent,
and adding components other than Plugins or Binders to Agents.</li>
 <li>The process for loading the CSMART configuration database has changed.
For details, see <a href="../csmart/doc/InstallAndTest.html">the CSMART Install 
instructions</a>
.</li>
 <li>Finally, there are a few known issues in this release. These include
occasional JVM errors that make use of the DataGrabber difficult in large
(Full-1AD) societies, noticable performance problems in CSMART, and bugs
in CSMART Agent recipes and Society Monitor. All of these will be addressed
in a patch release of Cougaar shortly. As always, see the <a href="http://www.cougaar.org/bugs">
Cougaar Bugzilla site</a>

      <p> <b>Build 9.1</b> is an interim release of Cougaar. Essential differences 
	    between 9.0 and 9.1 include: </p>
      <ul>
  <li> JDK version change.  Cougaar 9.1 (and all future versions) requires 
JDK 1.4 to compile and run. As of the time of this writing, JDK 1.4 is not
yet available in final form so the translation has been done using JDK 1.4
RC builds. </li>
 <li> JDBC 3.0 drivers are now supported.  org.cougaar.util.DBConnectionPool 
	      supports JDBC 3.0 interfaces.  Only this connection pool 	      class
has been ported.  Older, broken db connection pool 	      implementations
have been dropped.  In particular, 	      org.cougaar.mlm.plugin.LDMConnection
and associated 	      classes have been removed, along with LDMQueryPlugin 
	      (LDMSQLPlugin is uneffected). </li>
 <li>The GLM Stimulator Servlet, which allows injection of tasks into an
agent, as defined in an xml file.  <br>

      <p> <b>Build 9.0</b> is a major release of Cougaar. Essential differences
between 8.8 and 9.0 include:  </p>
      <ul>
 <li> Repackaging.&nbsp; See <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackage/Cougaar9.0RepackagingDetails.html">

scripts</a>
 in the repackaging directory (doc/ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackage).</li>
  <li> Standardize use of Plugin.&nbsp; Until version 8.4, PlugIn was prefered
to Plugin.  Since then, we have had a mix of uses. In this version, all references
to PlugIn have been expunged. To change PlugIn to Plugin in all your files
and filenames use the <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackage/PlugInToPlugin.pl">
PlugInToPlugin.pl</a>
 script in the repackaging directory (doc/ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackage).</li>
  <li> Servlets:</li>
  <br>
The Servlet server is now enabled by default (HTTP port 8800) and replaces 
the PSP server. During node initialization you will now see this message: 
        <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>Starting HTTP server on port: 8800</tt> <br>
All PSP base-classes have been deprecated, and all PSPs must be ported to
Servlets (see bug 1017). The existing PSP server will be removed in the 9.2
release and will no longer be supported. <br>
Many PSPs and PSP-client-applications have already been ported to use the
new servlet server, including:  
        <ul>
 <li> "/tasks" <i>(the ported "/alpine/demo/TASKS.PSP", which is used to
view an agent's blackboard)</i></li>
  <li> "/completion" <i>(view task allocation-result statistics)</i></li>
  <li> "/hierarchy" <i>(view agent relationships)</i></li>
  <li> "/load" <i>(merge of "?LOAD" and "PLUGIN_LOADER.PSP")</i>&nbsp;</li>

  <li> Basic Training Course Tutorials.&nbsp;</li>
  
        <ul>
 <li> The basic training course tutorial has been upgraded to include the
use of the new servlet capability which will replace the deprecated PSP capability. 
For each of the PSPs in the basic training course, a servlet has been implemented 
to provide the identical capability.&nbsp;</li>
  <li> The basic course tutorial exercises which use servlets have had their
build scripts, run scripts, and configuration files have been updated to
work effectively with the servlets.</li>
  <li> Bug 850 indicated a problem with using the batch file to run the HanoiNode 
tutorial. This has been fixed in version 9.0.</li>
 
        </ul>
  <li> App-Server enhancements to support the Node Manager</li>
  <li> MTS Componentization</li>
  <li> GLSClient and GLSInitServlet replace GLSGUIInitPlugin, GLSRescindPlugin, 
and SQLOplanPlugin. Now when starting one of the logistics domain societies, 
users must also run GLSInit.[sh|bat] to initiate processing (assuming that
the three latter plugins have been replaced in the configuration by GLSInitServlet).</li>
  <li> CSMART cleanup: See <a href="../csmart/doc/release-notes.txt">CSMART
release notes</a>
 for details. Notable highlights include:</li>
  
        <ul>
&nbsp; <li> Upgraded required Grappa to most recent version 1.2, which includes
the BBN modifications. See <a href="../sys/index.html">required jar file
documentation</a>
          </li>
  <li> Upgraded Ant build script to require Ant1.4.1</li>

 <h2> <a name="organization"></a>Organization of a Release&nbsp;</h2>
 When you download a Cougaar release, there are several logical pieces. 
  <ul>
   <li>Cougaar runtime files: these come from the <b>cougaar.zip</b> file and 
include jar files, startup scripts, and data files. These in turn are spread
out across several directories or "modules". The directories that come in
cougaar.zip do not contain source code or Javadoc, which is available separately.<br>

     <ul>
      <li>lib/: This directory contains the Cougaar-developed jar files.</li>
      <li>bin/: This directory contains all the primary Cougaar startup scripts.</li>
      <li>doc/: This is where Cougaar documentation is stored, including this file.
Note that the Developer's Guide and Javadoc come separately.</li>
      <li>configs/: All the basic runtime data and configuration files are stored
here. In various documents you will often see reference to "configs/common",
which subdirectory is found here, and includes common data files. Some simple
flat-file base Cougaar society definitions are also found here.</li>
      <li>aggagent/: This software module includes the Aggregation Agent architecture
for collecting data from various Cougaar Agents and summarizing it.</li>
      <li>blackjack/: This software module defines some military logistics supply-chain
Plugins and related classes and data files.</li>
      <li>bootstrap/: Cougaar classloader that ensures jar files in usual places
are included, without requiring CLASSPATH modifications.</li>
      <li>bol/: The Books Online Cougaar example application.</li>
      <li>build/: The scripts used to compile and build a Cougaar release.</li>
      <li>community/: Support for defining communities of Agents and their communitications.</li>
      <li>contract/: Plugin contracts - not completely supported.</li>
      <li>core/: The core Cougaar Agent architecture.</li>
      <li>csmart/: CSMART is the Cougaar Society Management, Analysis, and Reporting
Tool. Use it to configure, run, and monitor large Cougaar societies. See
<a href="../csmart/doc/index.html">csmart/doc/index.html</a></li>
      <li>datagrabber/: For collecting and displaying plan results, in
      particular TPFDD (military logistics) displays.</li>
      <li>glm/: Defines Plugins and data model for a military logistics domain
and application.</li>
      <li>glmtrans/: Transportation Plugins to support a military logistics application.</li>
      <li>javaiopatch/: Small JDK over-rides to support persistence.</li>
      <li>manager/: Support for management Agents to monitor the health of a Cougaar
application.</li>
      <li>planserver/: Deprecated interface support - use servlets instead.</li>
      <li>qos/: Quality of Service support for Message Transport</li>
      <li>quo/: More Message Transport support</li>
      <li>scalability/: Testing society for evaluating the scalability of the
Cougaar architecture.</li>
      <li>server/: The AppServer (or Node Server) is a daemon used by CSMART to
remotely startup and stop Cougaar Nodes.</li>
      <li>toolkit/: Various support utilities, particularly to support
      scheduling.</li>
      <li>uiframework/: Framework for constructing some UIs.</li>
      <li>util/: Cougaar component architecture and utility classes, including
logging.</li>
      <li>vishnu/: GA based scheduler.</li>
      <li>webserver/: Servlet support.</li>
      <li>webtomcat/: Integration with Apache Tomcat.</li> 
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Cougaar source: The source code for each of the various Cougaar modules,
along with Javadoc, is available in <b>&lt;module&gt;-dev.zip</b>. Here you
will also often find JUnit regression tests (in a sub-directory called "regress"),
and examples (in the "examples" sub-directory).  Of particular note is
<b>tutorial-dev.zip</b> which has the sources for a number of simple
	tutorials for learning Cougaar, plus examples, as used in the
	periodically offered Cougaar Tutorial classes (from
	tutorial-dev.zip).
</li>
   <li>Consolidated core API: The <b>cougaar-api.zip</b> contains the consolidated
Javadoc for the "basic" Cougaar modules, for extraction into the top-level
doc directory.</li>
   <li>Cougaar third-party support libraries: The <b>cougaar-support.zip</b>
 file contains third-party jar files and libraries, which when extracted
go in the sys/ directory.</li>
   <li><b>md5sums.txt</b>:&nbsp; md5 checksums of all the zips.</li>
   <li><b>build.out</b>: output of the build process</li>
   <li><b>errors.out</b>: Any errors or warnings encountered by build.</li>
 </ul>

  <b>To install Cougaar</b>: <br>
Go to the cougaar website (<a href="http://www.cougaar.org">www.cougaar.org</a>) 
to get the latest windows Cougaar installer which will install Cougaar as
well as a MySQL database.&nbsp; This will allow users to run off of a local
MySQL database. 
      <p><b>Note that if you are installing MySQL on linux or unix, you must 
instruct the database to translate all table names to lowercase</b> (which 
is the default on Windows machines).&nbsp; To do this, you must set the variable
lower_case_table_names=1 by including the line in /etc/my.cnf: </p>
      <p>[mysqld] <br>
set-variable&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; lower_case_table_names=1 </p>
      <p>Alternatively you can follow these instructions. <br>
<ol>
<li>You'll need cougaar.zip and cougaar-support.zip (the first time) to
get a runnable system.&nbsp; The rest are extras.&nbsp; Furthermore,
the cougaar-support contents do not change very often.
<li> The zips are designed to be unpacked in the same directory, e.g. 
on unix: <br>
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir cougaar 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd cougaar 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unzip /tmp/cougaar.zip 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unzip -o /tmp/cougaar-support.zip 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setenv COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH `pwd` 
</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
      <p>Note that $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/bin/Node and setarguments.bat set
the Cougaar start time with the following Node argument: <br>
-Dorg.cougaar.core.cluster.startTime=08/010/2005 <br>
This start time is optimal for the Oplan used with the sample military
logistics societies.&nbsp; 
      <br>

CSMART installation document</a>.<br>

 <h2> <a name="example"></a>Test Harness Example Implementations</h2>
We only maintain society configurations that we are currently using for testing
purposes and for&nbsp; Cougaar demonstrations. These society configurations 
are available in subdirectories under "configs" in the release. To execute 
these Cougaar societies, these nodes can be executed on a single computer 
or distributed across multiple computers.&nbsp; 
  <p>One society, <b><a
  href="ReleaseNotes/common/MiniTestConfig.html">minitestconfig</a></b> 
will work "out of the box". We intend to expand this test society
in subsequent releases in size and complexity to test new infrastructure
features and to provide reference examples of components component and service
design patterns. Plugin and component developers are encouraged to use 
<b>minitestconfig</b> as a starting point for testing their software for compliance
with the latest infrastructure release. Minitestconfig can be run as a multiple 
node, multiple host society.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Included in the distribution is a standard society derived from the military logistics
domain.<br>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li><b>Tiny/Small/Full-1AD</b>: This is a set of database based societies
where the configuration information is provided through the CSMART
database. They use
several military units and simulate various operations.  These configurations
are entirely configured and run through CSMART. These span in size from
TINY (fits on one machine) through SMALL (best run on 3 or 4 machines)
through FULL (usually requires at least 6 machines).  Each of these
may include the full-fledged TRANSCOM transportation scheduler (more 
compute intensive) or just a Stub scheduler (those with the -STUB  
suffix).  For details on configuring and running these CSMART societies,
see the <a href="../csmart/doc/InstallAndTest.html">CSMART
Installation instructions</a>.</li> 
  </ul>

  <h2> <a name="delivering"></a>Delivering Software Products&nbsp;</h2>
 Please see the Integration Information Area that can be found on the <a href="http://www.ultralog.net">
UltraLog</a> web site. 
  <p>All Plugin software must use the Java system parameter
  "org.cougaar.install.path" as the basis for all searches, data
  files, etc. For writing output, use "org.cougaar.workspace". For example, if your product is "tops," your classes will be in:&nbsp; </p>
   <blockquote>"$COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH\lib\tops.jar"</blockquote>
 and your java code could find your data files with:&nbsp; 
   <dir> 
     <dl>
       <dt> <font face="Courier New"><font size="-1">String path = System.getProperty("org.cougaar.install.path") +</font></font></dt>
       <dt> <font face="Courier New"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
File.separatorChar + "tops" +</font></font></dt>
       <dt> <font face="Courier New"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
File.separatorChar + "myData.dat";</font></font></dt>

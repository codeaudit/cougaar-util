<h2>
<a NAME="overview"></a>Overview of this Release</h2>
Build 9.0 is a major release of COUGAAR. Essential differences between
8.8 and 9.0 include:
<ul>
<li>
Repackaging.&nbsp; See the repackaging diagrams for details.&nbsp; To repackage
your source code use the <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackage/README">scripts</a>
in the repackaging directory (doc/ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackaging).</li>

<li>
Servlets</li>

<li>
Basic Training Course Tutorials.&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li>
The basic training course tutorial has been upgraded to include the use
of the new servlet capability which will replace the deprecated PSP capability.
For each of the PSPs in the basic training course, a servlet has been implemented
to provide the identical capability.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The basic course tutorial exercises which use servlets have had their build
scripts, run scripts, and configuration files have been updated to work
effectively with the servlets.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Bug 850 indicated a problem with using the batch file to run the HanoiNode
tutorial. This has been fixed in version 9.0.</li>

<li>
Node Manager</li>

<li>
MTS Componentization</li>

<li>
GLSClient and GLSInitServlet replace GLSGUIInitPlugIn, GLSRescindPlugIn,
and SQLOplanPlugIn. Now when starting one of the logistics domain societies,
users must also run GLSClient.[sh|bat] to initiate processing (assuming
that the three latter plugins have been replaced in the configuration by
GLSInitServlet).</li>
</ul>
Build 8.8.0 is a point release along COUGAAR 8.0 and represents 8.6.0 with
assorted bugs fixed and some minor new features, specifically to support
and incorporate Ultra*Log integration work previously done in 8.4.1. In
Particular, 8.8.0 is intended to be the final release before 9.0. 8.8.0
is the final snapshot of the 8.6.2 integration branch. Any third-party
software which works with 8.6.2 will work with 8.8.0. Notable additions
for this release include:
<ul>
<li>
Bugs fixed.</li>

<li>
<i>Manager</i> is an experimental/proof-of-concept module which attempts
to detect and react to unexpected node and server death. Right now, this
is a demo capability only, but may serve as a sneak preview into 9.x functionality.
A small (linux-only) example is documented in <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.0/NodeManager.txt">Node
Manager Demo Instructions</a>.</li>

<li>
MessageTransport Adaptability enhancements to include Traffic Generation
to aide in masking actual Cougaar message traffic.&nbsp; Its important
to note that single pieces of the the Message Transport Adaptibility architecture,
such as Secure Name Service access and Traffic Generation can be turned
on and off using -D arguments.&nbsp; For more details, please see the Parameters.html
catalog found in $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/doc/api, the <a href="details/JSSE-Keystore-Instructions.txt">JSSE
and keystore creation instructions</a> and the <a href="details/MTS-Adapt-Demo.htm">Message
Transport Adaptibility Demo document</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>Build 8.6.2 is a point release along COUGAAR 8.0 and represents
8.6.0 with assorted bugs fixed and some minor new features, specifically
to support and incorporate Ultra*Log integration work previously done in
8.4.1. Notable additions for this release include:
<ul>
<li>
Bugs fixed.</li>
</ul>
Build 8.6.1 is a point release along COUGAAR 8.0 and represents 8.6.0 with
assorted bugs fixed and some minor new features, specifically to support
and incorporate Ultra*Log integration work previously done in 8.4.1. Notable
additions for this release include:
<ul>
<li>
Third-party jars have been significantly updated. See
<a href="../sys/index.html">cougaar-support.zip:sys/index.html</a>
for a list of the packages, the included version numbers, notes and download
references.</li>
</ul>
Build 8.6.0 is a point release along COUGAAR 8.0 and will be the final
release under the ALP project.&nbsp; Future Cougaar releases will be under
the Ultra*Log project. Notable additions for this release include:
<ul>
<li>
Changes to plugin parameters defined in the cougaar.rc file.&nbsp; Please
see <a href="details/DataAccess.html">Data Access document</a> for the
current list of parameters needed to run a small-135 society.</li>

<li>
Heterogeneous Database Capability.&nbsp; The query based LDMPlugins now
support database connectivity via any JDBC driver.&nbsp; MySQL and PostgreSQL
database exports for running the SMALL-135 configuration are posted on
the Cougaar web site.&nbsp; <a href="details/HeterogeneousDatabase.html">HeterogeneousDatabase</a></li>

<li>
New Configuration database to replace "ini" files. This new database and
the Node enhancements that support reading from it allow running societies
without distributing multiple configuration files. For details, see the
JavaDocs for Node, the Cougaar Developer's Guide, and the CSMART User's
Guide.</li>

<li>
CSMART enhancements to support configuring, executing, and monitoring large
distributed societies using the above configuration database. This is now
the preferred mechanism for configuring, running, and monitoring large
distributed societies. For further details, see the CSMART User's Guide
and release documention in the CSMART module (csmart/doc/CSMART-Readme.txt
to start).</li>

<li>
The AppServer, which is used by CSMART to remotely create and destroy Cougaar
Node processes, has been enhanced to meet the new CSMART requirements.
The CSMART documentation contains basic usage details, and the "server"
module includes a "server/doc/README" text file.</li>

<li>
Generic <a href="details/Logging.html">logging facility</a>. Both logging
and logging control services provide a front-end to popular log4j third-party
logging package.</li>

<li>
Archiving architecture which allows old tasks to be deleted while a Cougaar
society is running. Views can still be obtained based on data that existed
in the past, but has been deleted from the running society.&nbsp; For more
details and screen shots from a test run, please see the <a href="details/ArchivingTest.htm">Archiving
Test document</a>.</li>

<li>
Enhancements to the generic UniversalExpanderPlugIn which expands tasks
according to sub-tasks defined in a database table. Enhancements include
better ability to defined task parameters, ability to specify more than
2 levels of expansion, and the ability to expand levels fully or expand
them into a single flat workflow. For details please see glm/doc/UniversalExpanderPlugIn.html</li>

<h2>
<a NAME="organization"></a>Organization of a Release&nbsp;</h2>
The files in an COUGAAR release fall into the following organizational
areas:
<ul>
<li>
"core:" domain independent agent architecture</li>

<li>
"glm:" LDM and PlugIns which have a logistics domain focus based on the
ALP program objectives</li>

<li>
"utility:" GSS and PlugIn Contracts</li>

<li>
"tools:" scalability and test tools</li>

<li>
"tutorial:" non-logistics sample societies and PlugIns</li>

<li>
"server:" centralized society initiation and management for testing, integration
and demonstration</li>
</ul>
The COUGAAR release will contain the following zip files:
<ul>
<li>
cougaar.zip:&nbsp; COUGAAR demo runtime - all built jar files, configs,
data, bin, minimum doc.</li>

<li>
cougaar-support.zip:&nbsp; All non-built supporting .jars (unpacks into
"sys" subdirectory where Bootstrapper will find them).</li>

<li>
cougaar-api.zip:&nbsp; the javadoc for all the main cougaar classes in
one place. unpacks to api/* instead of under doc as in previous releases.</li>

<li>
*-dev.zip:&nbsp; sources, docs (including javadoc) for each "public" module.</li>

<li>
md5sums.txt:&nbsp; md5 checksums of all the zips.</li>

<li>
build.out: output of the build process</li>
</ul>
To install Cougaar:
<br>Go to the cougaar website (<a href="http://www.cougaar.org">www.cougaar.org</a>)
to get the latest windows Cougaar installer which will install Cougaar
as well as a MySQL database.&nbsp; This will allow users to run off of
a local MySQL database rather than accessing an Oracle database located
in Cambridge, MA at BBN Technologies.
<p>Alternatively you can follow these instructions.
<br>1. You'll need cougaar.zip and cougaar-support.zip (the first time)
to get a
<br>runnable system.&nbsp; The rest are extras.&nbsp; Furthermore, the
cougaar-support
<br>contents do not change very often.
<p>2. the zips are designed to be unpacked in the same directory, e.g.
on
<br>unix:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir cougaar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd cougaar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unzip /tmp/cougaar.zip
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unzip -o /tmp/cougaar-support.zip
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setenv COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH
`pwd`
<p>Note that $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/bin/Node and setarguments.bat set the
Cougaar start time with the following Node argument:
<br>-Dorg.cougaar.core.cluster.startTime=08/010/2005
<br>This start time is optimal for the Oplan used with the small-135 society.&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="utilities"></a>Utilities in a Release&nbsp;</h2>
The following PSPs (in the GLM module) and LPS services are tested with
each release and should aid in PlugIn debugging and understanding society
behavior:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
alpine/demo/TASKS.PSP</li>

<li>
alpine/demo/PLUGIN_LOADER.PSP</li>

<li>
alpine/demo/SOCIETY_METRICS.PSP</li>

<li>
alpine/demo/OPLAN_EDIT.PSP</li>

<li>
?list?psps</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
To execute these PSPs, enter the following URL in your browser: http://&lt;hostname>.5555:&lt;service>
where &lt;service> might be /alpine/demo/TASKS.PSP
<h2>
<a NAME="example"></a>Test Harness Example Implementations</h2>
We only maintain society configurations that we are currently using for
testing purposes and for&nbsp; COUGAAR demonstrations. These society configurations
are available in subdirectories under "configs" in the release. To execute
these COUGAAR societies, these nodes can be executed on a single computer
or distributed across multiple computers.&nbsp;
<p>One society, <b><a href="MiniTestConfig.html">minitestconfig</a></b>
will work "out of the box". We intend to expand this test society in subsequent
releases in size and complexity to test new infrastructure features and
to provide reference examples of components component and service design
patterns. Plugin and component developers are encouraged to use <b>minitestconfig</b>
as a starting point for testing their software for compliance with the
latest infrastructure release. Minitestconfig can be run as a multiple
node, multiple host society.&nbsp;
<p>In addition, there is a much larger configuration in
<b>configs/small-135</b>.
The default configuration supports running a relatively small but interesting
two node society distributed across two machines.&nbsp; See the small-135.readme.html
file in the configuration directory for more information.&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="delivering"></a>Delivering Software Products&nbsp;</h2>
Please see the Integration Information Area that can be found on the <a href="http://www.ultralog.net">UltraLog</a>
web site.
<p>All PlugIn software must use the Java system parameter "org.cougaar.install.path"
or the environment variable COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH to find data files, scripts,
and external programs. For example, if your product is "tops," your classes
will be in:&nbsp;
<blockquote>"$COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH\lib\tops.jar"</blockquote>
and your java code could find your data files with:&nbsp;
<dir>
<dl>
<dt>
<font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>Properties props = System.getProperties();</font></font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>String path = props.getProperty("org.cougaar.install.path")
+</font></font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
props.getProperty("file.separator") + "tops" +</font></font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
props.getProperty("file.separator") + "myData.dat";</font></font></dt>
</dl>
</dir>

Cougaar is compiled and tested using the 1.3.1 release of JDK. We recommend
that users use this release. Cougaar uses the following Java extensions
that are not part of the default JDK 1.3.1 installation. These packages
should be obtained and installed according to the instructions accompanying
them:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/">Java Secure Socket Extension
(JSSE)</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>

read the latest Cougaar Developers Guide (CDG) and all release notes.&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="questions"></a>Questions and Bug Reports</h2>
In addition, email infrastructure questions and initiate community discussions
through cougaar-developers@cougaar.org. Bug and system-enhancement reports
can be submitted through the <a href="http://www.cougaar.org">COUGAAR</a>
website.&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="bugs"></a>Known bugs and other issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>
The NodeServer module (server.jar) does not currently work as an executable
jar file because of an unresolved dependency on core.jar. Until this is
fixed, an appserver instance will have to have a specified classpath which
includes core.jar.</li>

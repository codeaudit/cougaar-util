</ul>

Build 8.6.0 is a point release along COUGAAR 8.0 and will be the final
release under the ALP project.&nbsp; Future Cougaar releases will be under
the Ultra*Log project. Notable additions for this release include:
<ul>
<li>
Changes to plugin parameters defined in the cougaar.rc file.&nbsp; Please
see <a href="details/DataAccess.html">Data Access document</a> for the
current list of parameters needed to run a small-135 society.</li>

<li>
Heterogeneous Database Capability.&nbsp; The query based LDMPlugins now
support database connectivity via any JDBC driver.&nbsp; MySQL and PostgreSQL
database exports for running the SMALL-135 configuration are posted on
the Cougaar web site.&nbsp; <a href="details/HeterogeneousDatabase.html">HeterogeneousDatabase</a></li>

<li>
New Configuration database to replace "ini" files. This new database
and the Node enhancements that support reading from it allow running
societies without distributing multiple configuration files. For
details, see the JavaDocs for Node, the Cougaar Developer's Guide, and
the CSMART User's Guide.</li>

<li>
CSMART enhancements to support configuring, executing, and monitoring
large distributed societies using the above configuration database. This is
now the preferred mechanism for configuring, running, and monitoring
large distributed societies. For further details, see the CSMART
User's Guide and release documention in the CSMART module
(csmart/doc/CSMART-Readme.txt to start).</li>

<li>
The AppServer, which is used by CSMART to remotely create and destroy 
Cougaar Node processes, has been enhanced to meet the new CSMART 
requirements.  The CSMART documentation contains basic usage details,
and the "server" module includes a "server/doc/README" text file.</li>

<li>
Generic <a href="details/Logging.html">logging facility</a>. Both logging
and logging control services provide a front-end to popular log4j third-party
logging package.</li>

<li>
Archiving architecture which allows old tasks to be deleted while a Cougaar
society is running. Views can still be obtained based on data that existed
in the past, but has been deleted from the running society.&nbsp; For more
details and screen shots from a test run, please see the <a href="details/ArchivingTest.htm">Archiving
Test document</a>.</li>

<li>
Enhancements to the generic UniversalExpanderPlugIn which expands tasks
according to sub-tasks defined in a database table. Enhancements include
better ability to defined task parameters, ability to specify more than
2 levels of expansion, and the ability to expand levels fully or expand
them into a single flat workflow. For details please see glm/doc/UniversalExpanderPlugIn.html</li>
</ul>
Build 8.4.2 is a patch release of COUGAAR 8.4.0.&nbsp; Notable additions
for this release include:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Additional javadoc support </b>New javadoc doclet generates additional
file <a href="api/Parameters.html">Parameters.html</a> which is a catalog
of System Properties (-D flags) used. The file is generated on the basis
of @property javadoc tags in the source code. Also, generated javadoc is
now placed within doc directories rather than parallel to the doc directory.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Added a logging service for the standardized logging of messages and a
logging control service to control how those messages are ouput. Also added
a PSP that controls logging output using this service.</li>
</ul>
Build 8.4.1 is a patch release of COUGAAR 8.4.0.&nbsp; Notable additions
for this release include:

code to org.cougaar.core.mts. (for details see <a href="details/MessageTransport-8.4.htm">MessageTransport-8.4.html</a>)</li>

<li>
Prototype of the QoS Montoring services were added. These Node-level services
can determine the status of remote agents and their underlying resources
(CPU and Bandwidth).&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Reimplement metrics data services to componentize node and agent level
metrics (for details see <a href="details/MetricsServices.html">MetricsServices.html</a>)</li>

<li>

<h2>
<a NAME="organization"></a>Organization of a Release&nbsp;</h2>
The files in an COUGAAR release fall into the following organizational
areas:
<ul>
<li>
"core:" domain independent agent architecture</li>

<li>
"glm:" LDM and PlugIns which have a logistics domain focus based on the
ALP program objectives</li>

<li>
"utility:" GSS and PlugIn Contracts</li>

<li>
"tools:" scalability and test tools</li>

<li>
"tutorial:" non-logistics sample societies and PlugIns</li>

<li>
"server:" centralized society initiation and management for testing, integration
and demonstration</li>
</ul>
The COUGAAR release will contain the following zip files:
<ul>
<li>
cougaar.zip:&nbsp; COUGAAR demo runtime - all built jar files, configs,
data, bin, minimum doc.</li>

<li>
cougaar-support.zip:&nbsp; All non-built supporting .jars (unpacks into
"sys" subdirectory where Bootstrapper will find them).</li>

<li>
cougaar-api.zip:&nbsp; the javadoc for all the main cougaar classes in
one place. unpacks to api/* instead of under doc as in previous releases.</li>

<li>
*-dev.zip:&nbsp; sources, docs (including javadoc) for each "public" module.</li>

<li>
md5sums.txt:&nbsp; md5 checksums of all the zips.</li>

<li>
build.out: output of the build process</li>
</ul>
To install Cougaar:
<br>Go to the cougaar website (<a href="http://www.cougaar.org">www.cougaar.org</a>)
to get the latest windows Cougaar installer which will install Cougaar
as well as a MySQL database.&nbsp; This will allow users to run off of
a local MySQL database rather than accessing an Oracle database located
in Cambridge, MA at BBN Technologies.
<p>Alternatively you can follow these instructions.
<br>1. You'll need cougaar.zip and cougaar-support.zip (the first time)
to get a
<br>runnable system.&nbsp; The rest are extras.&nbsp; Furthermore, the
cougaar-support
<br>contents do not change very often.
<p>2. the zips are designed to be unpacked in the same directory, e.g.
on
<br>unix:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir cougaar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd cougaar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unzip /tmp/cougaar.zip
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unzip -o /tmp/cougaar-support.zip
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setenv COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH
`pwd`
<p>Note that $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/bin/Node and setarguments.bat set the
Cougaar start time with the following Node argument:
<br>-Dorg.cougaar.core.cluster.startTime=08/010/2005
<br>This start time is optimal for the Oplan used with the small-135 society.&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="utilities"></a>Utilities in a Release&nbsp;</h2>
The following PSPs (in the GLM module) and LPS services are tested with
each release and should aid in PlugIn debugging and understanding society
behavior:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
alpine/demo/TASKS.PSP</li>

<li>
alpine/demo/PLUGIN_LOADER.PSP</li>

<li>
alpine/demo/SOCIETY_METRICS.PSP</li>

<li>
alpine/demo/OPLAN_EDIT.PSP</li>

<li>
?list?psps</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
To execute these PSPs, enter the following URL in your browser: http://&lt;hostname>.5555:&lt;service>
where &lt;service> might be /alpine/demo/TASKS.PSP
<h2>
<a NAME="example"></a>Test Harness Example Implementations</h2>
We only maintain society configurations that we are currently using for
testing purposes and for&nbsp; COUGAAR demonstrations. These society configurations
are available in subdirectories under "configs" in the release. To execute
these COUGAAR societies, these nodes can be executed on a single computer
or distributed across multiple computers.&nbsp;
<p>One society, <b><a href="MiniTestConfig.html">minitestconfig</a></b>
will work "out of the box". We intend to expand this test society in subsequent
releases in size and complexity to test new infrastructure features and
to provide reference examples of components component and service design
patterns. Plugin and component developers are encouraged to use <b>minitestconfig</b>
as a starting point for testing their software for compliance with the
latest infrastructure release. Minitestconfig can be run as a multiple node, multiple host
society.&nbsp;
<p>In addition, there is a much larger configuration in
<b>configs/small-135</b>.
The default configuration supports running a relatively small but interesting
two node society distributed across two machines.&nbsp; See the small-135.readme.html
file in the configuration directory for more information.&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="delivering"></a>Delivering Software Products&nbsp;</h2>
Please see the Integration Information Area that can be found on the <a href="http://www.ultralog.net">UltraLog</a>
web site.
<p>All PlugIn software must use the Java system parameter "org.cougaar.install.path"
or the environment variable COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH to find data files, scripts,
and external programs. For example, if your product is "tops," your classes
will be in:&nbsp;
<blockquote>"$COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH\lib\tops.jar"</blockquote>
and your java code could find your data files with:&nbsp;
<dir>
<dl>
<dt>
<font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>Properties props = System.getProperties();</font></font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>String path = props.getProperty("org.cougaar.install.path")
+</font></font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
props.getProperty("file.separator") + "tops" +</font></font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
props.getProperty("file.separator") + "myData.dat";</font></font></dt>
</dl>
</dir>

<h3>
<a NAME="jvm"></a>Java Virtual Machine Requirements&nbsp;</h3>
Cougaar is compiled and tested using the 1.3.1 release of JDK. We recommend
that users use this release. Cougaar uses the following Java extensions
that are not part of the default JDK 1.3.1 installation. These packages
should be obtained and installed according to the instructions accompanying
them:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/">Java Secure Socket Extension
(JSSE)</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
User Interface Development&nbsp;</h3>
Please refer to the UI design doc.&nbsp; For general PSP help, see: <a href="ui/PSPServices.html">PSPServices</a>.
<h2>
<a NAME="future"></a>Future Releases</h2>
There will be further releases as we address system enhancements and deficiencies.
Please watch the cougaar-developers@cougaar.org email list and carefully
read the latest Cougaar Developers Guide (CDG) and all release notes.&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="questions"></a>Questions and Bug Reports</h2>
In addition, email infrastructure questions and initiate community discussions
through cougaar-developers@cougaar.org. Bug and system-enhancement reports
can be submitted through the <a href="http://www.cougaar.org">COUGAAR</a>
website.&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="bugs"></a>Known bugs and other issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>
OutOfMemory error/thread problem when running a 2 node small-135 society
on one Linux machine.&nbsp; Its best to use 2 machines if running a multi-node
small-135 society.</li>

<li>
The NodeServer module (server.jar) does not currently work as an executable
jar file because of an unresolved dependency on core.jar. Until this is
fixed, an appserver instance will have to have a specified classpath which
includes core.jar.</li>

<li>
The Inventory Manager does not handle blanket failed allocations very well.
If a universal allocator at a leaf unit fails all refills to an InventoryManager
immediately below that supply point, there are failed refills, but the
level below that there is no shortfall and no failed refills. This is related
to a bug where confidence levels 0.5 or below should not be counted as
success and aggregating failed allocations back to their expansion is not
working properly. This should be fixed in a future release. Until this
is fixed large shortfalls of supply do not reflect very well in the result.</li>

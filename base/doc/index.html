<!-- COUGAAR 9.4.0 COUGAAR 9.4.0 COUGAAR 9.4.0 COUGAAR 9.4.0 COUGAAR 9.4.0 -->

<p>
Build 9.4 is a significant release of Cougaar 9 intended to add
additional functionality and address known issues in 9.2.
<ul>
<li>
The standard initializer service implementations will no longer construct
ComponentDescription with empty lists when no parameter list is
given.  Component.setParameter will be called IFF 
the .ini file or CSMART database actually specifies arguments.  The
implication is that Components should not put initialization code in
the setParameter method if the Component ever is constructed without
parameters.
</li>
<li>
New documentation has been added that summarizes
<a href="details/PersistenceGuidelines.html">persistence and agent mobility</a>.  
In particular, the document covers:<ul>
  <li>Basic definitions for "persistence", "mobility", "reconciliation", 
	    "rehydration", etc.</li>
	<li>Requirements for Cougaar software (plugins, components, 
	    services, and agents) to fully support persistence, restarts, 
			and agent mobility.</li>
  <li>Failure symptoms if persistence or mobility is not correctly
      supported, and how developers can track down and fix these 
			bugs.</li>
  <li>Tests and expected results.  The tests include JVM-kills and 
	    the use of agent mobility to both move and restart agents.</li>
  <li>Detailed notes on how lazy persistence and reconciliation work, 
	    which will help clear up the mysterious behavior you might 
			see.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The LoggingService is available earlier (during NodeAgent's HIGH
subcomponent pass).  Furthermore, there is a new class
<a href="api/org/cougaar/util/log/Logging.html">org.cougaar.util.log.Logging</a>
which provides a variety of static methods giving access to loggers
and allowing the set up of thread-specific logging contexts.  Plugins
and most components are still encouraged to use the existing
<a href="api/org/cougaar/core/service/LoggingService.html">LoggingService</a>.
</li>
<li>
Several agent mobility bugs have been fixed:<ul>
  <li>Bug 1218: Move to an unknown node now fails quickly instead of 
	              waiting forever</li>
  <li>Bug 1316: Work around for "before Context" bug, the full fix is
	              planned for 9.4.1</li>
  <li>Bug 1368: MTS "FlushAspect" warning is no longer generated</li>
  <li>Bug 1369: Fixed race condition between loading and mobility,
	              and prevent simultaneous move requests</li>
  <li>Bug 1382: Don't do state reconciliation when moving agents</li>
  <li>Bug 1423: Agent binders now support state capture</li>
  <li>Bug 1549: Fixed memory leak in community services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Minor fix to support running TPFDD Viewer. Avoids necessity for
workaround described in 9.2.2 - errata.</li>
<li>CSMART configuration database has changed slightly. You should
re-load your configuration database to get the latest functionality,
in particular Community construction and initialization.</li>
<li>The domain database (ie mysqldump.9.2.txt) now includes additional
data, and should also be re-loaded.</li>
<li>CSMART now includes an interface for editing Community
information. Separate community configurations are available for each
CSMART Experiment. This new tool is available from the "Communities"
pane in the CSMART Experiment Builder.</li>
<li>CSMART includes numerous usability and bug fixes, all described in
detail in the CSMART <a href="../csmart/doc/release-notes.txt">release notes</a>.</li>
<li>CSMART bug fixes include several to address items in the errata
for 9.2.2, including: <br><ul>
<li>Add Dos Recipe export scripts</li>
<li>Minor fix to allow seeing non-Plugin Agent contents in
Console Node Info window.</li>
<li>Avoid some NPEs. See the CSMART release <a
href="../csmart/doc/release-notes.txt">notes</a> for details.</li>
<li>Allow arbitrary insertion points in Specific Insertion
recipes. This solves bug 1387 mentioned in the errata document.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Community and Mobility Domains are now included by default, using the
LDMDomains.ini file, and need not be included specially. In addition,
CSMART 1AD societies (from the CSMART database) include the Community
Plugin in all domain Agents. However, if you wish to use Communities
from a Node Agent, or add new Agents, you must still include the
Community Plugin via a recipe. The required Mobility components are
automatically included via the default CSMART recipes included in a
1AD society.</li>
<li>Community configuration can now be loaded from either the configuation
database through CSMART or through an xml file (communities.xml).  See
community/doc/README.  A system property org.cougaar.community.configfile="filename"
can be used to specify a particular community configuration xml file.</li>
<li>Caching of community information at the CommunityService level has been
implemented and is enabled by default.  Caching may be turned off by setting the 
system parameter org.cougaar.community.caching="off"</li>
<li>
The Bootstrapper now, by default, uses XURLClassLoader rather than
BootstrapClassLoader.  XURLClassLoader is pretty much identical to 
URLClassLoader except without the same serialization/RMI implications.
Unlike BootstrapClassLoader, XURLClassLoader implements the
recommended method of extending ClassLoaders (e.g. by extending
findClass rather than loadClass).  This change brings Cougaar into
closer compliance to standard java applications.  The most significant
implication of this change is that CLASSPATH should include no Cougaar
jars other than bootstrap.jar when using the bootstrapper - failure to
follow this rule will result is various java reflection failures, due
to mismatches between the system classloader and the application one.
this change implements RFE 1434 (bug 1434) and fixes bug 1413.
The old behavior can be invoked by specifying
<em>-Dorg.cougaar.bootstrap.classloader.class=org.cougaar.bootstrap.BootstrapClassLoader</em>
on the java command line.
</li>
<li> AEViewer servlet now uses introspection to determine the type of
OperatingMode. It should be possible to use the servlet to set the value
of any OM that has a String constructor.  </li>
<li> The objects listed in the AEViewer servlet are now sorted 
alphabetically  (enhancement bug 1490) </li>

<li>
The Thread service Scheduler has been significantly rewritten and
greatly simplified.  It now limits Java thread usage much more
strictly and reliably.
</li>

<li>
The MTS will now drop messages if particular classes of Exception are
thrown during serialization or deserialization.  For this release the
relevant exception classes are GeneralSecurityException and
NotSerializableException.
</li>

<li>
The Metrics Services are better coupled with the RSS.  Several example
uses, including servlets and plugins, have been provided (see 
<a href=details/MetricServiceRuntimeNotes.html>
MetricServiceRuntimeNotes</a>).
</li>

</ul>

<!-- COUGAAR 9.2.2 COUGAAR 9.2.2 COUGAAR 9.2.2 COUGAAR 9.2.2 COUGAAR 9.2.2 -->

<p>
Build 9.2.2 is a patch release of 9.2 intended to address known issues
in 9.2.1.
<ul>
<li>Message Transport Service:
<ul>
<li>Removed a redundant API on the Registery interface for looking up
    the node's address. The NameSupport.getNodeMessageAddress() should
    be used instead.</li>
<li>If a client requests the MessageTransportService and is not a
    MessageTransportClient, the service provider will now throw an
    IllegalArgumentException instead of returning Null. </li>
</ul>
<li>Thread Service:<br>
Thread service now returns a Schedulable instead of a
    Thread. Schedulables are thread proxies from the user's perspective
    (things which can be started).  From the system perspective the
    implementation class is the bridge between Schedulers and lava
    Threads.  Java Threads are only associated with Schedulables as needed
    (i.e. when the Scheduler allows the Schedulable to run).<br>
    Version 9.4 will include extensive changes to and simplifications
    of the thread services.</li>
<li>Topology Service: QoSMonitorService was removed and replaced with the topology service.</li>
<li>
New service org.cougaar.core.service.BlackboardQueryService is a form of
very simple but very limited blackboard access for clients which need
only non-transactional, read-only and relatively occasional blackboard
queries.  See <a href="api/org/cougaar/core/service/BlackboardQueryService.html">
api/org/cougaar/core/service/BlackboardQueryService.html</a> and
<a href="https://www.alpine.bbn.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1140">
bugzilla bug 1140</a> for more information.
</li>
<li>New CSMART Topology view allows monitoring mobile agents and the complete current
society topology.</li>
<li>CSMART now support specifying variable component load priority.</li>
<li>There have been multiple CSMART bug fixes. See the 
<a href="../csmart/doc/release-notes.txt">CSMART release notes</a> for
details.</li>
<li>The included MySQL JDBC Driver has been upgraded to version
2.0.14. Changes include bug fixes with Timestamps and performance
improvements. Be sure to re-install 3rd party jars from cougaar-support.zip</li>
<li>Bug 1313, "Separate topology from MTS"
Created new "TopologyReaderService" for components to list all agents, hosts, 
nodes, find out which host an agent is on, etc.  This simplifies the MTS and 
allows for future agent mobility enhancements.</li>
<li>Bug 1073, "Servlet-loader should pass servlet as the service-requestor"
Servlets now use the "BlackboardQueryService", which allows better servlet 
security binding.  Servlets must now use a "setSimpleServletSupport(..)" 
method instead of a "<classname>(SimpleServletSuport ..)"
constructor.</li>
<li>Bug 1290, "Tomcat needs to read from the server.xml for which SSLServer"
Created new system properties for setting the web-server socket factories.  
This will be used for NAI custom SSL server configuration.</li>
<li>Bug 1291, "Tomcat SSL should not throw exception when keystore environm"
Related to bug 1291, which allows a custom socket factory to configure the 
keystore.</li>
<li>Bug 1163, "Agent Identity Service"
Integrated new agent crypto identity service into agent and node, and 
modified the agent to transfer this identity when the agent moves.  The 
default built-in service provider implementation does nothing and can be 
overridden by a HIGH-priority component specified in the node ".ini" 
configuration.</li>
<li>Bug 1358, "Topology manager does not support MTS message address"
Created new "system" category in the topology service, and modified the MTS 
to register itself with this category.</li>
<li>Bug 1380, "CSMART topology display must show hostname instead of IP add"
Modified topology services to use the host's name instead of IP address. </li>
</ul>


<!-- COUGAAR 9.2.1 COUGAAR 9.2.1 COUGAAR 9.2.1 COUGAAR 9.2.1 COUGAAR 9.2.1 -->

<p>
Build 9.2.1 is a patch release of 9.2 intended to address known issues
in 9.2, and further stabilize a few of the APIs. APIs that have
changed include: BlackboardService (and therefore PluginAdapter); 
ThreadService; CommunityService.

<ul>
<li>The AggAgent should be run in a node using  the 
JDK Hotspot Server VM (-server flag). On
some windows systems this requires modifying the System path such that
JDK/bin/java is found before any JRE version of java.
Use of the server VM appears to avoid one known bug VM bug
(see <a href="https://www.alpine.bbn.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1252">
bugzilla bug 1252</a>) but may slow down general execution speed
and exposes another VM bug (see <a href="https://www.alpine.bbn.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1322">
bugzilla bug 1322</a>).
</li>
<li>The <em>javaiopatch.jar</em> file is now always required in the JVM bootclasspath. 
This was added to support Agent Mobility even if Persistence is disabled. 
Node startup scripts have been updated to match. Users may
need to update their AppServer properties files to match. See the
samples in ../server/data for details.</li>
<li>Add new Environment variable / -D argument:
COUGAAR_WORKSPACE / org.cougaar.workspace. This directory, which defaults to CIP/workspace, is
where all runtime components should do all file output. This includes
persistence. Future releases may restrict output to this area.</li>
<li>Most known issues in CSMART have been addressed, including
performance issues and problems with the Society Monitor and Agent
Insertion Recipe. See the 
<a href="../csmart/doc/release-notes.txt">CSMART release notes</a> 
for further details.</li>
<li>A new servlet has been added : the Completion Watcher Servlet.  It
measures execution time of an agent.  For more information, see the 
<a href="../glm/doc/CompletionWatcherServlet.html">Completion Watcher Servlet User's Guide</a> 
for further details.</li>
<li>The AEViewerServlet has been added. It shows the values of basic 
adaptivity objects, i.e., Conditions, OperatingModes, and OperatingModePolicies.
Users can edit OperatingModePolicies and set the values of OperatingModes with
this servlet.</li>
<li>The OperatingModePolicyManager has been altered to set the OperatingModes
referred to in non-adaptive OperatingModePolicies directly, without using the
AdaptivityEngine. Non-adaptive OperatingModePolicies are defined as ones that
have a TRUE ifCondition and instruct OperatingModes to have a single point
range value.</li>
<li> The Bootstrapper has be refactored to allow clean and flexible
extensions, particularly for the use by a high security bootstrap
mechanism.  The various calling scripts have been cleaned up, and
bootstrap.jar is now an executable jar file.
The system property org.cougaar.useBootstrapper is now deprecated: users
should execute Bootstrapper directly or use classpath rather than
trying to have it both ways.  See 
<a href="api/org/cougaar/bootstrap/Bootstrapper.html">api/org/cougaar/bootstrap/Bootstrapper.html</a> 
(if cougaar-api.zip has been installed) for details.
</li>
<li>Added support for component removal through both the AgentContainment Service
and the <em>/load</em> Servlet. 
<li>
Standard Cougaar components now support a number of load-time
priorities which allow externally-specified components to be loaded in various ways
interspersed with "built in" components of a container.  See
<a href="api/org/cougaar/core/component/ComponentDescription.html">ComponentDescription</a> 
for discussion of the priorities,
<a href="api/org/cougaar/core/component/ContainerSupport.html">ContainerSupport</a> 
for information on how the standard Container implementation
interprets this information, and 
<a href="api/org/cougaar/core/node/INIParser.html">INIParser</a> 
for a discussion of the <em>.ini</em> file extensions which allow this
information to be specified. CSMART does not yet support this
mechanism - until it does, all CSMART-specified components will always be
loaded at COMPONENT-level priority.  This functionality is fully
implemented in 9.2.1 for Plugins, and Agent Components (including NodeAgent).
<li>
The Thread Service API has changed, see
<a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2.1/threadservice_info.txt">ThreadService Changes</a>.
<li>
As of 9.2.1, COUGAAR now provides more fine-grained control 
over the externalization of AttributedMessages. In particular, a new set of 
join points has been defined in the interfaces MessageWriter and 
MessageReader. Attaching Aspect delegates at these interfaces provides the 
ability to control and/or monitor 
<a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2.1/MessageExternalizationAspects.htm">message externalization</a>.
<li>Configuration database has been updated to have only lowercase table names in all
database dump files and q files. Unused configuration database tables have been removed.
<li>Enhanced community support. This includes:
<ul>
<li>Support for Attribute Based Address messaging is now provided and used for 
CommunityChangeNotifications.
<li>The CommunityServiceAPI has been updated to provide support for Attribute Based Addressing.
<li>Community configuration is now loaded into a communities context in the yellow pages from
two new database tables in the configuration database instead of from a xml file.
<li>SpokesAgentDescriptor and SpokesagentList classes have been removed.
<li>See the 
<a href="../community/doc/README">Community Readme File</a> 
describing how to acess community components.
</ul>
<li>New Blackboard Timestamp capabilities have been added:
<ul>
<li>An envelope-level timestamp subscription that allows a plugin to monitor
the start and end time of blackboard transactions.
<li>A new subscription type that captures the creation and modification times for blackboard objects,
and its service-based API (BlackboardTimestampService).
</ul>
<li>The servlet server now returns an improved error code if the user requests an unknown servlet path
(also addresses Bugs 1242, 1298).
</ul>


<!-- COUGAAR 9.2 COUGAAR 9.2 COUGAAR 9.2 COUGAAR 9.2 COUGAAR 9.2 -->

<p>
Build 9.2 is a point release along COUGAAR 9.0. 
It includes assorted <a href="#bugs">bug fixes</a> and 
several new infrastructure features, specifically to support
Ultra*Log defense team development for 2002.

<ul>
<li>
JDK version change. Cougaar 9.2 requires JDK 1.4 to compile and run.
<li>
New Packages and Repackaging.
The main change is that core.jar (core.*, planning.*, util.*) is now split
into bootstrap.jar (bootstrap.*), util.jar (util.*, core.component.*) and
core.jar (core.* exluding core.component.*, planning.*).
The Cougaar Developers' Guide includes a picture of the Package Mapping.
<ul>
<li>
For a list of all packages see <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2/Packages92.htm">Packages92.htm</a>.
<li>
For a list of all modules and the packages contained 
in each module see <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2/PackagesToModules92.htm">PackagesToModules92.htm</a>.
</ul>
<li>
The Cougaar Adaptivity Engine has been added which is responsible for setting the 
operating modes of a number of sub-components based on conditions within a component.
For details on this new Cougaar mechanism see the Adaptivity Engine section
of the Cougaar Developer's Guide (CDG) available on the Cougaar website.
<li>
Agent mobility has been redesigned to provide a service-based API and
a blackboard-based "MoveAgent" API, which simplifies plugin usage.  A
response code is now returned to the requestor, indicating the move
status (SUCCESS/FAILURE).  An example servlet is provided to initiate 
agent mobility from a browser. See the CDG for details.
<li>
The Cougaar Communitiy Infrastructure has been added (Community Service API,
Community Blackboard Objects). See the CDG for details on this new mechanism.
</li>
<li>
Domain componentization. 
Starting with Cougaar 9.2, domains will be implemented as org.cougaar.core.components.Components
contained by an org.cougaar.core.DomainManager. This change primarily impacts domain developers
ans is discussed in more detail in the CDG. Interactions with the domains continue to be
provided by the org.cougaar.core.service.DomainService which has not changed.
As a result of the domain componentization, it is now possible to load domains into an agent
through the agent.ini file. LDMDomains.ini continues to specify a common set of domains for the entire
society and command line arguments can be used to specify domains for a given node.
Domains loaded through the agent.ini are only available within that agent.
Agents which communicate with each other should load the same set of domains.
Without a common set of domains cross agent messages will not be correctly interpreted.
</li>
<li>
"Relay" support has been added.  A Relay is a generic interface for a 
blackboard object, plus a logic provider that is always loaded, that 
simplifies inter-agent communication.  This API is now used for
adaptivity engine updates, mobility requests, and policy distribution;
it will likely be used to define other agent-to-agent(s) protocols.  
See the CDG for details.
</li>
<li>
Support for <i> attribute-based message addresses </i> has been added
which allows to specify the recipient(s) of a message based on the attributes
of an agent within the community. See the CDG for details.
</li>
<li>
HealthReport and ManagementAgent. The manager module includes a demo configuration
designed to display a preliminary implementation of the HealthReport functionality.
The configuration expands minitestconfig by adding a Manager. The Manager agent registers
itself as a Manager in NameServer (in the future, the CommunityService should be used instead).
In addition, OplanHealthReportPlugin has been added to each of the other agents which generates
a HealthReport each time an Oplan is added. The HealthReport uses an AttributeBasedAddress
to direct the report to all agents which have registered as Managers. See manager.doc.README.txt
and the CDG for details.
</li>
<li>
NodeAgent implementation.
Starting with Cougaar 9.2, most of the node-level services are implemented
as plugins and other subcomponents of a new object, the NodeAgent. 
This is a real Cougaar agent that has the task of providing node-level 
lifeline and management services to its node. For details, see the
new section in the Cougaar Architecture Document (CAD) and the
documentation on the NodeControlService and the AgentIdentificationService
in the CDG.
</li>
<li>
Logging has been adopted in several sections of the infrastructure, 
in plugins, and some servlets.  The 
<a href="details/Logging.html">logging documentation</a>
has been expanded and now contains better end-user instructions.
</li>
<li>
Anonymous change reports have been added, which allows a plugin to
tell if an object was "publishChange()"'d without specifying a
ChangeReport.  See the CDG for details.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="details/Servlet.html">Servlet server</a> has been upgraded to Tomcat 4.0.
</li>
<li>
Metrics Service supports integrating multiple raw sensors into a coherent
view of the Cougaar society which can be accessed by any component in the
nodes' containment hierarchy. Note that the definitions for the paths (reader access) and
keys (writer access) will evolve in future releases.
<ul>
<li> The MetricsService allows to read integrated metric values in real time.</li>
<li> The MetricsUpdateService allows to publish raw metrics into the service.</li>
</ul>
An example is given in the MetricsTestAspect in the MTS package.
For further details, see the CDG.</li>
<li>
A reusable Thread Service is now available at all levels of the Cougaar containment hierarchy.
In the future, this thread service will be integrated into the alarms and plugin dispatcher
which should be transparent. Component should not "new" threads and timers, but should use the thread service. 
For more details, see the CDG.
</li>
<li> The Message Transport has added several features which allow aspects to be combined with fewer conflicts.
Some of these features include return codes, using attribute-based message instead of envelopes, and
complete componentization of aspects and link protocols.
</li>
<li> Persistence supports writing snapshots to multiple media using
media-specific plugins. This allows persistence data to be stored 
locally, remotely, redundantly, and in general, robustly.
Persistence parameters can be controlled by the adaptivity engine
through the PersistenceControlPlugin.
<li> <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2/bol_info.txt">BooksOnLine (BOL)</a> lessons 1 and 2 are part of the distribution.</li>
<li> <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.2/stoplight_info.txt">Stoplight Chart Usage</a>.</li>
<li> Windows users of the AppServer must include a line in their server properties file
setting the SYSTEMROOT environment variable for database driver support.
See server/data/win-server-sample.props for details.
</li>
<li> Added and fixed <a
href="ReleaseNotes/9.2/compload_info.txt">ContainmentService and
LoadServlet</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../csmart/doc/index.html">CSMART</a> now supports running arbitrary Cougaar societies,
not just those in the CSMART configuration database. All Cougaar
developers can now use CSMART to configure, control, and monitor their
societies. You may now create a CSMART "experiment" by loading the
definition from old-style INI files (allowing you to run all tutorial
examples, minitestconfig, etc), or by creating it directly from the
CSMART User Interface.</li>
<li>CSMART also includes support for adding components to a Node
Agent, and adding components other than Plugins or Binders to
Agents.</li>
<li>The process for loading the CSMART configuration database has
changed. For details, see <a
href="../csmart/doc/InstallAndTest.html">the CSMART Install
instructions</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, there are a few known issues in this release. These
include occasional JVM errors that make use of the DataGrabber
difficult in large (Full-1AD) societies, noticable performance problems in CSMART, and bugs in
CSMART Agent recipes and Society Monitor. All of these will be
addressed in a patch release of Cougaar shortly. As always, see the
<a href="http://www.cougaar.org/bugs">Cougaar Bugzilla site</a> for
details and status on bugs.</li>
</ul>



<!-- COUGAAR 9.1 COUGAAR 9.1 COUGAAR 9.1 COUGAAR 9.1 COUGAAR 9.1 -->

<p>
Build 9.1 is an unstable release of COUGAAR. Essential differences
	    between 9.0 and 9.1 include:
<ul>

<li>
JDK version change.  Cougaar 9.1 (and all future versions) requires
JDK 1.4 to compile and run. As
of the time of this writing, JDK 1.4 is not yet available in final
form so the translation has been done using JDK 1.4 RC builds.
</li>
<li>
JDBC 3.0 drivers are now supported.  org.cougaar.util.DBConnectionPool
	      supports JDBC 3.0 interfaces.  Only this connection pool
	      class has been ported.  Older, broken db connection pool
	      implementations have been dropped.  In particular,
	      org.cougaar.mlm.plugin.LDMConnection and associated
	      classes have been removed, along with LDMQueryPlugin
	      (LDMSQLPlugin is uneffected).

<!-- COUGAAR 9.0 COUGAAR 9.0 COUGAAR 9.0 COUGAAR 9.0 COUGAAR 9.0 -->

<p>
Build 9.0 is a major release of COUGAAR. Essential differences between
8.8 and 9.0 include:

<ul>
<li>
Repackaging.&nbsp; See <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackage/Cougaar9.0RepackagingDetails.html">repackaging
details and package maps</a>.&nbsp; To repackage your source code use the
<a href="ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackage/README">scripts</a>
in the repackaging directory (doc/ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackage).</li>

<li>
Standardize use of Plugin.&nbsp; Until version 8.4, PlugIn was prefered to Plugin. 
Since then, we have had a mix of uses. In this version, all references to PlugIn have
been expunged. To change PlugIn to Plugin in all your files and
filenames use the <a href="ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackage/PlugInToPlugin.pl">PlugInToPlugin.pl</a> script in the repackaging directory (doc/ReleaseNotes/9.0/repackage).</li>

<li>
Servlets:</li>

<br>The Servlet server is now enabled by default (HTTP port 8800) and replaces
the PSP server. During node initialization you will now see this message:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>Starting HTTP server on port: 8800</tt>
<br>All PSP base-classes have been deprecated, and all PSPs must be ported
to Servlets (see bug 1017). The existing PSP server will be removed in
the 9.2 release and will no longer be supported.
<br>Many PSPs and PSP-client-applications have already been ported to use
the new servlet server, including:

<ul>
<li>
"/tasks" <i>(the ported "/alpine/demo/TASKS.PSP", which is used to view
an agent's blackboard)</i></li>

<li>
"/completion" <i>(view task allocation-result statistics)</i></li>

<li>
"/hierarchy" <i>(view agent relationships)</i></li>

<li>
"/load" <i>(merge of "?LOAD" and "PLUGIN_LOADER.PSP")</i>&nbsp;</li>

<li>
all 6 CSMART PSPs</li>

<li>
the Inventory PSP</li>

<li>
both TPFDD/datagrabber PSPs</li>

<li>
the agg-agent PSPs</li>

<li>
the tutorial PSPs</li>
</ul>
See:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="details/Servlet.html">doc/details/Servlet.html</a> for an introduction
to the servlet server, including example servlets and PSP-porting instructions.</li>

<li>
<a href="../webserver/doc/install.html">webserver/doc/install.html</a>
for server configuration options, including optional HTTPS support.</li>

<li>
<a href="details/PortedPSPs.html">doc/details/PortedPSPs.html</a> for a
table of (old-PSP --> new-Servlet)</li>
</ul>

<li>
Enhanced "LoggingService" support for logging within plugins and other
components.  See 
<a href="details/Logging.html">doc/details/Logging.html</a>
for details.</li>

<li>
Basic Training Course Tutorials.&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li>
The basic training course tutorial has been upgraded to include the use
of the new servlet capability which will replace the deprecated PSP capability.
For each of the PSPs in the basic training course, a servlet has been implemented
to provide the identical capability.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The basic course tutorial exercises which use servlets have had their build
scripts, run scripts, and configuration files have been updated to work
effectively with the servlets.</li>

<li>
Bug 850 indicated a problem with using the batch file to run the HanoiNode
tutorial. This has been fixed in version 9.0.</li>
</ul>

<li>
App-Server enhancements to support the Node Manager</li>

<li>
MTS Componentization</li>

<li>
GLSClient and GLSInitServlet replace GLSGUIInitPlugin, GLSRescindPlugin,
and SQLOplanPlugin. Now when starting one of the logistics domain societies,
users must also run GLSInit.[sh|bat] to initiate processing (assuming
that the three latter plugins have been replaced in the configuration by
GLSInitServlet).</li>

<li>
CSMART cleanup: See <a href="../csmart/doc/release-notes.txt">CSMART release
notes</a> for details. Notable highlights include:</li>

<ul>&nbsp;
<li>
Upgraded required Grappa to most recent version 1.2, which includes the
BBN modifications. See <a href="../sys/index.html">required jar file documentation</a></li>

<li>
Upgraded Ant build script to require Ant1.4.1</li>

<li>
Repackaging and code cleanup</li>For a list of currently known/open bugs

<li>
Use core logging service</li>

<li>
Remove PSP support, using Servlets throughout instead, including new GLSInitServlet</li>

<li>
New Servlet Insertion Recipe</li>
</ul>

<li>
TPFDD Viewer added features :&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li>
TPFDD Display status line that shows total items, tons, volume, and time
to create the TPFDD.</li>

<li>
An Export feature on the TPFDD Display that exports the TPFDD data in a
csv format suitable for Excel.&nbsp;</li>

<br>(See the datagrabber/doc/TPFDDViewer-Introduction.html file for more
information on these new features.)</ul>
</ul>
Build 8.8.0 is a point release along COUGAAR 8.0 and represents 8.6.0 with
assorted bugs fixed and some minor new features, specifically to support

<h2>
<a NAME="organization"></a>Organization of a Release&nbsp;</h2>
The files in a COUGAAR release fall into several organizational
areas. These include:

<ul>
<li>
"core:" domain independent agent architecture</li>
<li>
"glm:" LDM and Plugins which have a logistics domain focus based on the
ALP program objectives</li>
<li>
"utility:" GSS and Plugin Contracts</li>
<li>
"tools:" scalability and test tools</li>
<li>
"tutorial:" non-logistics sample societies and Plugins</li>

<li>
"server:" centralized society initiation and management for testing, integration
and demonstration</li>
</ul>
The COUGAAR release will contain the following zip files:

<ul>
<li>
cougaar.zip:&nbsp; COUGAAR demo runtime - all built jar files, configs,
data, bin, minimum doc.</li>
<li>
cougaar-support.zip:&nbsp; All non-built supporting .jars (unpacks into
"sys" subdirectory where Bootstrapper will find them).</li>
<li>
cougaar-api.zip:&nbsp; the javadoc for all the main cougaar classes in
one place. unpacks to api/* instead of under doc as in previous releases.</li>
<li>
*-dev.zip:&nbsp; sources, docs (including javadoc) for each "public" module.</li>
<li>
md5sums.txt:&nbsp; md5 checksums of all the zips.</li>
<li>
build.out: output of the build process</li>
</ul>

<b>To install Cougaar</b>:
<br>Go to the cougaar website (<a href="http://www.cougaar.org">www.cougaar.org</a>)
to get the latest windows Cougaar installer which will install Cougaar
as well as a MySQL database.&nbsp; This will allow users to run off of
a local MySQL database rather than accessing an Oracle database located
in Cambridge, MA at BBN Technologies.
<p><b>Note that if you are installing MySQL on linux or unix, you must
instruct the database to translate all table names to lowercase</b> (which
is the default on Windows machines).&nbsp; To do this, you must set the
variable lower_case_table_names=1 by including the line in /etc/my.cnf:
<p>[mysqld]
<br>set-variable&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; lower_case_table_names=1
<p>Alternatively you can follow these instructions.
<br>1. You'll need cougaar.zip and cougaar-support.zip (the first time)
to get a
<br>runnable system.&nbsp; The rest are extras.&nbsp; Furthermore, the
cougaar-support
<br>contents do not change very often.
<p>2. the zips are designed to be unpacked in the same directory, e.g.
on
<br>unix:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir cougaar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd cougaar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unzip /tmp/cougaar.zip
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unzip -o /tmp/cougaar-support.zip
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setenv COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH
`pwd`
<p>Note that $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/bin/Node and setarguments.bat set the
Cougaar start time with the following Node argument:
<br>-Dorg.cougaar.core.cluster.startTime=08/010/2005
<br>This start time is optimal for the Oplan used with the small-135
society.&nbsp;
<br>For instructions on installing and using CSMART, see the <a
href="../csmart/doc/InstallAndTest.html">CSMART installation document</a>.<br>

<h2>
<a NAME="example"></a>Test Harness Example Implementations</h2>
We only maintain society configurations that we are currently using for
testing purposes and for&nbsp; COUGAAR demonstrations. These society configurations
are available in subdirectories under "configs" in the release. To execute
these COUGAAR societies, these nodes can be executed on a single computer
or distributed across multiple computers.&nbsp;
<p>One society, <b><a href="MiniTestConfig.html">minitestconfig</a></b>
will work "out of the box". We intend to expand this test society in subsequent
releases in size and complexity to test new infrastructure features and
to provide reference examples of components component and service design
patterns. Plugin and component developers are encouraged to use <b>minitestconfig</b>
as a starting point for testing their software for compliance with the
latest infrastructure release. Minitestconfig can be run as a multiple
node, multiple host society.&nbsp;
<p>In addition, there is a much larger configuration in
<b>configs/small-135</b>.
The default configuration supports running a relatively small but interesting
two node society distributed across two machines.&nbsp; See the small-135.readme.html
file in the configuration directory for more information.&nbsp;

<h2>
<a NAME="delivering"></a>Delivering Software Products&nbsp;</h2>
Please see the Integration Information Area that can be found on the <a href="http://www.ultralog.net">UltraLog</a>
web site.
<p>All Plugin software must use the Java system parameter "org.cougaar.install.path"
or the environment variable COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH to find data files, scripts,
and external programs. For example, if your product is "tops," your classes
will be in:&nbsp;
<blockquote>"$COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH\lib\tops.jar"</blockquote>
and your java code could find your data files with:&nbsp;
<dir>
<dl>
<dt>
<font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>Properties props = System.getProperties();</font></font></dt>

<dt>
<font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>String path = props.getProperty("org.cougaar.install.path")

      <h2> <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

This file contains the release notes for Cougaar 11.2.
<p>
Please see our <a href="FAQ.html">Cougaar FAQ</a>
(<a href="http://cougaar.org/faq.html">online version</a>) for a high-level
introduction to the Cougaar agent architecture, system requirements, 3rd party software,
and pointers to additional documentation.
<p>
Please also visit our
<a href="http://www.cougaar.org">Cougaar Website</a> for the latest
news, documentation, and Cougaar builds. 

      <h2> <a name="license"></a>License</h2>
Cougaar is available the Cougaar Open Source
    License (COSL).  See <a href="License.txt">License.txt</a> or
<a href="http://cougaar.org/license.html">cougaar.org/license.html</a>.

      <h2> <a name="requirements"></a>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Java 2 SDK, version 1.4.2</b>:  Cougaar I/O is very closely tied to
the specific java implementation, so usually depends on a particular
release of the jdk. We have not observed any compatibility problems 
across service releases (e.g. "_01" versus "_03"). Other 1.4 versions,
while not supported, are likely to be possible with a small amount of
effort. There are no concrete plans (so far) to support j2se
1.5. Versions older than 1.4 are unsupported, as the current codebase
requires built-in features such as assert, Collections, JSSE, etc.
</li>
<li><b>Third-party libraries</b>:  Detailed requirements and jarfile versions are discussed in
<a href="../sys/index.html">sys/index.html</a>.  When a package
allows redistribution, we have included it in <a href="../sys">the
sys subdirectory</a> as part of the cougaar-support.zip package. 
</li>
<li><b>No OS requirement</b>:  Cougaar developers use a variety of operating
systems, including Linux, Windows and Mac OSX. There are no particular
known compatibility issues across platforms.
</li>
<li><b>No special hardware requirement</b>:  Cougaar can be used on hardware ranging
from very small(See the CougaarME project) through large machines.
SMP and HyperThreading are fully supported.  
</li>
</ul>

      <h2> <a name="overview"></a>Overview of this Release</h2>
Please see our website (<a href="http://cougaar.org/errata/">http://cougaar.org/errata/</a>) for updated information on problems/workarounds
that were detected/posted after this Cougaar version was released.
The errata directory is organized by cougaar release number.  For
example, the errata page for Cougaar 11.0 is <a href="http://cougaar.org/errata/cougaar1100/errata.html">http://cougaar.org/errata/cougaar1100/errata.html</a>.


  <!-- COUGAAR 11.2 COUGAAR 11.2 COUGAAR 11.2 COUGAAR 11.2 COUGAAR 11.2 -->
<p> <b>Build 11.2</b>
<ul>
<li>Converted minitestconfig and tutorials to run completely from XML. Running of MiniNode
does not require the database.  All ini files have been removed as they
are no longer supported.</li>
<li>
org.cougaar.planning.plugin.PluginSanityBinder is an optional new
binder for use with plugins.  When inserted, it will complain whenever
a bound object (e.g. plugin) publish adds/changes a task which did not
originate in the agent.  As an added extra bonus, this is a moderately
good example of a simple but functional Binder.
</li>
<li>
There is a service alternative to ConfigFinder in the form of
ConfigurationService. The service is provided by org.cougaar.core.node.ConfigurationServiceComponent
which is loaded by default only in XML configurations. 
See cougaar bug (RFE) 2569.
</li>
<li>
ActiveSubscriptionObject actions may now be delayed from immediate
(upon object publish) to LogicProvider time.  This is more correct,
but breaks a fair amount of old code. In particular, new code should
avoid expecting that objects change immediately at publish time - the
most common problems are dependence on Task.getPlanElement() and
immediate updates to Assets RoleSchedules after allocation or
reassignment.  See ActiveSubscriptionObject for more information.
This new option defaults to the old behavior, but will probably switch
to the more correct semantics in a future release.  When enabled,
turns on extensive debugging code which notes problematic usage. (see
cougaar bug 3663)
</li>
<li>
Support running plugins in a mode where only a single transaction may
be open at one time (default is off: that is, fully parallel plugin
operation). See cougaar bug 3664.
</li>
<li>GLSExpanderPlugin supports a -D argument which forces a
persistence after the GLS task has been propogated. See the source for
that plugin.
</li>
<li>The RescindLP now does many sanity checks on the addition and
removal of objects. In particular, it enforces that Tasks are added
before PlanElements that handle them, and child tasks after the
PlanElements. Typically the result is that many tasks without a parent
task (because an infrastructure rescind is in progress) are
removed. System properties permit disabling this behavior.
</li>
<li>
New XSL Style sheets.
</li>
<li> New XML Node startup scripts to use -D args specified in XML
files and apply XSL style sheets.</li>
<li>
New Components and component load order, removing hard coded
components.
</li>
<li>
Many fewer native threads created directly - more use of the Thread
Service.
</li>
<li> New OperationalSuperior concept.
</li>
<li> New optional core servlet, QuiescenceStateServlet, which shows the
quiescence status of individual Nodes and the agents within those
nodes.
</li>
<li> Multiple planning object tweaks: synchronize access to key members,
avoid serializing un-necessary members, and add debug logging on acess
to other members.
</li>
<li> Added component to restrict the number of threads per node. </li>
<li> Added component to restrict the number of threads per agent. </li>
<li> PluginHelper: New method which plugins should use when removing a
task from its workflow, to recalculate the aggregated Allocation
Result if necessary.</li>
<li> Added multiple utilities.</li>
<li> Multiple enhancements in initializers to reduce String consing,
LogginService instances, and other memory enhancements. In particular,
community file is only parsed once per Node. </li>
<li> Added new BlackboardAlert object for indicating a problem on the
local blackboard for higher-level application resolution.</li>
<li> MessageTransportClient API change: added getIncarnationNumber. </li>
<li> Added DestinationLink validity support. </li>
<li> Added MTS OldIncarnationAspect to ignore messages from an old
instance of an agent that has restarted elsewhere. </li>
<li> Restore prototype cache on rehydration. </li>
<li> Added more regression tests.</li>
<li> Further work for propogating Allocation Result changes up to a
task that was Expanded. In particular support a change to
undefined. See bug 3462.</li>
<li> Multiple fixes to optimize performance when persistence is
disabled. In particular, consolidate tuples to allow GC of un-ncessary
tuples between persists.</li>
<li> Multiple fixes to avoid locking agent when persistence is
slow.</li>
<li> Drop explicit garbage collection before persistence. This means
persistence may temporarily store removed objects.</li>
<li> Improve algorithm efficiency for detecting Node-level
queiscence. </li>
<li> Reduce usage of deprecated blocking WP calls. </li>
<li> Modified API for PluginAlarm to take an absolute time instead of
a delay, allowing for consistent usage between base classes.</li>
<li> Alarms now use the ThreadService for scheduling.</li>
<li> Added a SimpleRelayExample to core/relay package.</li>
<li> Moved Ping society and configuration to new ping module. </li>
<li> Shortened Node quiescence announcement delay to 20 seconds, and
added -D argument to configure this value.</li>
<li> Suppress some YP errors that may be transient while component
re-tries. </li>
<li> Updated Vishnu server 3rd party jar to include a performance
improvement.</li>
<li> Support community service access control. </li>
<li> Added new -D argument to suppress reconciliation
(org.cougaar.core.node.SkipReconciliation). </li>
<li> Added trivial single-node MTS implementation. </li>
<li> Apply updated & simplified BSD-derived copyright notice. </li>
<li> Require reasonable AspectScorePoints in ScoringFunctions. </li>
<li> Do not propogate add/change of Allocations of Tasks that are not
on the blackboard (have just been rescinded).</li>
<li> Multi-threading fixes to GLM's ClusterOPlan fix to ensure start &
end times are consistent.</li>
<li> Javadoc cleanup.</li>
<li> Suppress resending the self Organization if only LocalPG changes
have happened (as in OPlanWatcherLP).</li>
</ul>

  <!-- COUGAAR 11.0 COUGAAR 11.0 COUGAAR 11.0 COUGAAR 11.0 COUGAAR 11.0 -->

<p> <b>Build 11.0</b> is a major release, including multiple new
  pieces of functionality.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Jena to version 2.0 and Xerces to 2.6.0: <ul>
  <li>The new Jena jar required an update to icu4j.jar, and the addition
of antlr.jar, jakarta-oro-2.0.5, and rdf-api-2001-01-19</li>
  <li>The updated Xerces changed names to xercesImpl and xml-apis.jar
(split implementation from APIs).</li>
  <li>Servicediscovery code was changed to support the new
  Jena. Additionally, we use the built-in Jena file-caching. We still
  list the cached files in proxyTable.txt, but this is not just
  documentation. We no longer use custom caching. Additionally,
  Time.daml was added to the set of cached files.</li>
  <li>Jena2 now uses log4j. To turn down Jena WARNings, in particular
  from the RDFDefaultErrorHandler, specify the log4j property
  "log4j.category.com.hp.hpl.jena=ERROR".</li>
</ul></li>
<li>GLS tasks may no longer be rescinded. For each Oplan stage, the
GLSInitServlet now sends a new GLS task with the additional oplan
stage - leaving the old tasks behind. It is generally bad usage to
modify a task in place to have entirely different meaning. In this
case, it appeared to cause confusion about the meaning of the
allocation results. See bug 3407.</li>
<li>The MTS implementation has been factored into a separate 
module and project.  In CougaarForge, it is now the "std" module of
the "mts" project. Cougaar builds package it as "mtsstd.jar". 
The major effect of this refactoring is that most of the classes 
previously in org.cougaar.core.mts are now in org.cougaar.mts.std 
(e.g. those which <em>implement</em> the MTS interface have changed
packages, while those which <em>define</em> the interface have not.
See <a href="ReleaseNotes/11.0/mts-refactor.txt">ReleaseNotes/11.0/mts-refactor.txt</a> for
details.  Also see the perl script <a href="ReleaseNotes/11.0/mts-refactor.pl">ReleaseNotes/11.0/mts-refactor.pl</a>
which will do most of the substitutions requires to port 10.0 code to
11.0.  As a side effect of the refactoring, there is a new 
service available at the node level SocketFactoryService which allows
clients to find an appropriate SocketFactory without needing to 
know about the MTS implementation which may be supporting it.
</li>

<li>
    Lanes have been added to the Thread Services.  This allows finer
    tuned control over thread policies (max. running, queue ordering,
    etc).  The service APIs have some new methods in support of
    this.  Old methods continue to work and simply use the default
    lane.  For more details see <a
    href="ReleaseNotes/11.0/thread-lanes.html">Thread Lanes</a>. 
</li>

<li> Minimal MTS and Thread Services have been defined.  For more
    details see <a
    href="ReleaseNotes/11.0/minimal-services.html">Minimal
    Services</a></li>

<li>Multiple changes to Service Discovery. These make specifying
matchmaker scoring functions much easier, and provide better support for
dynamic provider availability changing. AvailabilityChangeMessages can
come in, causing the SD plugins to work to ensure they have contracts
covering the required intervals.</li>
<li>Refactored the DeletionPlugin to make it a generic BBoard object
deletion API. See org.cougaar.core.plugin.deletion package. </li>
<li>Added a new GLM Plugin: <code>org.cougaar.mlm.plugin.organization.ReportChainDetectorPlugin</code> to notice when a Superior/Subordinate hierarchy is complete.</li>
<li>The uiframework no longer requires the non-open source
datagrabber module for compilation. Actual usage of some pieces will
likely still require that software.</li>
<li>Reworked quiescence detection mechanism to avoid logic
problems. Quiescence detection is now more sensitive. (Bug 3359)</li>
<li>Task.getPreferredValue now returns Double.NaN instead of -1.0 when
the value is undefined (cbug 2919).
</li>
<li>The base unix shell scripts have been greatly simplified.
setarguments and setlibpath are gone, fully replaced by the boost
script (now used by the rest of the scripts).  Node now fully
subsumes the functionality of the now deleted XMLNode and PNode scripts.
</li>
<li>The initialization services now create ComponentDescription
parameters as unmodifiable List objects, rather than as (mutable)
Vectors.  This means that plugins and other components with a 
setParameter method will get called with a List rather than a Vector
(which is, after all, also instanceof List). This closes a security hole
(cougaar bug 3263) and drops one more use of Vector.  Note that legacy
plugins (extending PluginAdapter) continue to see a Vector if they
call getParameters() -- while the returned value is mutable, the 
security exploit cannot be used in this case.
</li>
<li>Most DOS scripts now support directories with a space (" ") in the
name. This does _not_ currently include the DB load
scripts. Additionally, the bash / csh scripts are not covered.</li>
<li>Changed default agent start time in the scripts to be 12:05am on
8/10/05</li>
<li>Multiple other minor bugs fixed (3323, 3423, 3424, 3438, 3448, 3420,
3431, 3221, 3223, 3224, 3181, 3440, 3403, 3427...)</li>
<li>Dropped very old files from various modules.</li>
<li>Various caching, interning, & other modifications to reduce memory usage.</li>
<li>Refactored & cleaned up the tutorials, dropping the old
"faststart" tutorials, which were broken.</li>
<li>Various toolkit module enhancements to reduce memory usage.</li>
<li>Do not use the Verb object constructor - it is now protected. (bug
2661).</li>
<li>Multiple changes to clean up code, remove unused variables, sort
imports, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <!-- COUGAAR 10.4.6 COUGAAR 10.4.6 COUGAAR 10.4.6 COUGAAR 10.4.6 COUGAAR 10.4.6 -->

<p> <b>Build 10.4.6</b> is a minor release, including minor improvements
in a number of services and multiple bug fixes.  It also adds support for
distributed hierarchical yellow pages, and service discovery through those.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Bug 3315: Fix up specification of agentStartTime. Now uses the full hours,
minutes, seconds of system GMT time for the specified day. Allows
specification of the hours and minutes, and an offset for more
accuracy. See the bug report for details.</li>
<li>Added support for service discovery using distributed YPServers. The 
default behaviour is unchanged, i.e.  a single YPServer. For the distributed 
case, each agent belongs to a YPCommunity which is served by a YPServer. The 
YP communities are organized along the same lines as the command hierarchy. 
Service discovery uses the community service to traverse the hierarchy of 
YPServers to find the providers which most closely match the client's 
specification.
</li>
<li>Modified GLS task generation. A separate GLS task is created for each 
oplan stage. Each task has the set of oplan stages which were valid at the 
time it was created
</li>
<li>RFE 3162: ServiceDiscovery ClientPlugin forces a persist after FindProviders
is complete - killing an agent before that point when using
ServiceDiscovery is not supported.</li>
<li>Bug 3324: Suppress RDF startup warnings from ServiceDiscovery</li>
<li>Bug 3313: Fix problem of MTS holding messages forever</li>
<li>Bug 3330: Ensure first metric on queue is processed.</li>
<li>Bug 3331: In MTS, only drop due to timeout on receiver if enabled
by a -D flag.</li>
<li>Bug 3340: In MTS Gossip stuff, move WP calls out of a
synchronize.</li>
<li>Bug 3343: Fix a QuO gui synchronization issue.</li>
<li>Bug 3345: Various Gossip scalability improvements.</li>
<li>Bug 3346: Filter metrics Gossip to send only credible info.</li>
<li>Bug 3348: Drop log level for DeliveryVerification and RogueThread
to WARN after 100 seconds.</li>
<li>Bug 3351: Expose the Contract API to allow using servlets instead
of pop-up windows.</li>
<li>Bug 3357: Run QoS schedulables in serial instead of parallel.</li>
<li>Bug 3358: Add a synchronization in QuO jar.</li>
<li>Bugs 3316, 3317, 3318: WP performance improvements</li>
<li>Bug 3341: Fix a WP replication forwarding bug.</li>
<li>Fix AdaptivityEngine servlet to be able to change OpMode
settings</li>
<li>Implement Serializable in a ServiceDiscovery object.</li>
<li>SDRegistrationPlugin, matchmaker plugin: small changes to support
proper quiescence.</li>
<li>Bug 3332: UniversalAllocatorPlugin now restores its sink asset
from the blackboard on rehydration.</li>
<li>Bug 3334: GenericTablePlugin avoids publishChanging PlanElement if
the ReportedAR.isEqual(EstimatedAR) already.</li>
<li>Bug 3337: Fix .equals method for TwoPointScoringFunction.</li>
<li>Bug 3333: ReceiveNotificationLP: Suppress un-necessary
publishChange of PlanElements if ReceivedAR is already .isEqual the
ReportedAR.</li>
</li>Bug 3352: Fix ExpansionImpl to properly re-wire the workflow of
subtasks, avoiding later illegal publishRemove warnings.</li>
<li>Tweak local Juddi jar to support closing DB connections.</li>
<li>Community caches are now per-Node (bug 3354)</li>

 <h2> <a name="organization"></a>Organization of a Release&nbsp;</h2>
 When you download a Cougaar release, there are several logical pieces. 
  <ul>
   <li>Cougaar runtime files: these come from the <b>cougaar.zip</b> file and 
include jar files, startup scripts, and data files. These in turn are spread
out across several directories or "modules". The directories that come in
cougaar.zip do not contain source code or Javadoc, which is available separately.<br>

     <ul>
      <li>lib/: This directory contains the Cougaar-developed jar files.</li>
      <li>bin/: This directory contains all the primary Cougaar startup scripts.</li>
      <li>doc/: This is where Cougaar documentation is stored, including this file.
Note that the Developer's Guide and Javadoc come separately.</li>
      <li>configs/: All the basic runtime data and configuration files are stored
here. In various documents you will often see reference to "configs/common",
which subdirectory is found here, and includes common data files. Some simple
flat-file base Cougaar society definitions are also found here.</li>
      <li>aggagent/: This software module includes the Aggregation Agent architecture
for collecting data from various Cougaar Agents and summarizing it.</li>
      <li>bootstrap/: Cougaar classloader that ensures jar files in usual places
are included, without requiring CLASSPATH modifications.</li>
      <li>build/: The scripts used to compile and build a Cougaar release.</li>

    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Cougaar source: The source code for each of the various Cougaar modules,
along with Javadoc, is available in <b>&lt;module&gt;-dev.zip</b>. Here you
will also often find JUnit regression tests (in a sub-directory called "regress"),
and examples (in the "examples" sub-directory).  Of particular note is
<b>tutorial-dev.zip</b> which has the sources for a number of simple
	tutorials for learning Cougaar, plus examples, as used in the
	periodically offered Cougaar Tutorial classes (from
	tutorial-dev.zip).
</li>
   <li>Consolidated core API: The <b>cougaar-api.zip</b> contains the consolidated
Javadoc for the "basic" Cougaar modules, for extraction into the top-level
doc directory.</li>

  <b>To install Cougaar</b>: <br>
Go to the cougaar website (<a href="http://www.cougaar.org">www.cougaar.org</a>) 
to get the latest windows Cougaar installer which will install Cougaar as
well as a MySQL database.&nbsp; This will allow users to run off of a local
MySQL database. 
      <p><b>Note that if you are installing MySQL on linux or unix, you must 
instruct the database to translate all table names to lowercase</b> (which 
is the default on Windows machines).&nbsp; To do this, you must set the variable
lower_case_table_names=1 by including the line in /etc/my.cnf: </p>
      <p>[mysqld] <br>
set-variable&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; lower_case_table_names=1 </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Alternatively you can follow these instructions. <br>
<ol>
<li>You'll need cougaar.zip and cougaar-support.zip (the first time) to
get a runnable system.&nbsp; The rest are extras.&nbsp; Furthermore,
the cougaar-support contents do not change very often.
<li> The zips are designed to be unpacked in the same directory, e.g. 
on unix: <br>
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir cougaar 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd cougaar 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unzip /tmp/cougaar.zip 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unzip -o /tmp/cougaar-support.zip 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setenv COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH `pwd` 
</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
      <p>Note that $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/bin/Node and setarguments.bat set
the Cougaar start time with the following Node argument: <br>
-Dorg.cougaar.core.cluster.startTime=07/11/2005 <br>
      <br>

 <h2> <a name="example"></a>Test Harness Example Implementations</h2>
We only maintain society configurations that we are currently using for testing
purposes and for&nbsp; Cougaar demonstrations. These society configurations 
are available in subdirectories under "configs" in the release. To execute 
these Cougaar societies, these nodes can be executed on a single computer 
or distributed across multiple computers.&nbsp; 
  <p>One society, <b> minitestconfig</b> 
will work "out of the box". We intend to expand this test society
in subsequent releases in size and complexity to test new infrastructure
features and to provide reference examples of components component and service
design patterns. Plugin and component developers are encouraged to use 
<b>minitestconfig</b> as a starting point for testing their software for compliance
with the latest infrastructure release. Minitestconfig can be run as a multiple 
node, multiple host society.&nbsp; </p>

  <h2> <a name="delivering"></a>Delivering Software Products&nbsp;</h2>
  <p>All Plugin software must use the Java system parameter
  "org.cougaar.install.path" as the basis for all searches, data
  files, etc. For writing output, use "org.cougaar.workspace". For example, if your product is "tops," your classes will be in:&nbsp; </p>
   <blockquote>"$COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH\lib\tops.jar"</blockquote>
 and your java code could find your data files with:&nbsp; 
   <dir> 
     <dl>
       <dt> <font face="Courier New"><font size="-1">String path = System.getProperty("org.cougaar.install.path") +</font></font></dt>
       <dt> <font face="Courier New"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
File.separatorChar + "tops" +</font></font></dt>
       <dt> <font face="Courier New"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
File.separatorChar + "myData.dat";</font></font></dt>

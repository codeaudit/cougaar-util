<h2>Overview</h2>

<p> This section describes how to configure <em>small footprint</em>
Cougaar societies that use minimal resources (cpu, memory, network)
and have minimal survivability requirements. These configuration
options can be used to deploy a Cougaar society in an
<em>embedded</em> processing environment, for example a hand-held
computer running Linux. Embedded Cougaar is a pruned version of the
standard Cougaar installation and uses the standard Java VM
(1.4.2). For a Cougaar version which uses a restricted Java VM, see
Cougaar ME.
<h3>Background</h3>

<p> The Cougaar infrastructure is highly configurable.  Cougaar
societies can be configured to operate in a wide range of operating
environments, from a single stand-alone host to a survivable society
with hundreds of hosts distributed over a potentially malicious
wide-area network. Cougaar's default configuration is designed to
deploy Cougaar societies in a relatively benign local-area network,
such as an enterprise network behind a firewall. For deployments with
higher survivability requirements, additional components and agents
can be added, including the security and robustness defenses developed
under the Ultralog program.  As a result, the most common emphasis
when configuring a Cougaar society is on <em>adding</em> components in
support of the application's functionality and survivability
requirements. But embedded deployments need to <em> remove </em> all but
the most essential components. 

<p> Cougaar can be stripped down to deploy a society efficiently on an
 embedded computer.  Cougaar infrastructure can even be configured
 without Agent support, that is, using only Cougaar's component model
 to make a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) for deploying
 stand-alone Java applications that require rich plugin support. These
 <em>embedded</em> applications do not need the survivability support
 required by distributed societies.

<p>When a society is deployed on a single node, performance can be
increased by a factor of three by removing the unnecessary Node-level
components that are designed to support survivability.  Since this
<em>single-node</em> configuration runs on a single host, an
additional 7x performance increase can be realized because inter-agent
communication stays within the Node, i.e. messages are not serialized
or sent over sockets.  The total performance increase of single-node
configuration can therefore be more than a factor of 20, which is very
useful for debugging a society's functionality before deployment or
for deploying societies on embedded processors.  The society's Agent
plugins do not have to be modified for deployment in distributed
environments; adding Node-level components to increase survivability
is sufficient.

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p> Embedded Cougaar involves determining the minimum set
of components needed to meet the society's survivability requirements.
There are three main steps:
<ol>
  
<li>The minimal Cougaar <a href="install.html" > installation</a>
    must be identified and installed on the embedded
    device. Here the goal is to reduce the disk space to store the
    Cougaar society. For example, this step will prune the jars,
    configuration data, and shell scripts out of the standard Cougaar
    release.
    
<li> The society XML <a href="configuration.html">
 configuration</a> must be modified to remove unnecessary
 components. Here the goal is to remove components from the standard
 configuration, which are not required in the embedded deployment.
 For example, this step may involve adding new rules for generating
 the society or modifying the XSL Node definition template.

<li> The society <a href="operation.html" > execution</a> (run
          scripts) must use additional switches to execute the reduced
          society XML configuration. Here the goal is to get the Java
          VM configured to restrict the use of runtime resources, such
          as stack and heap size. As of Cougaar B11_2, these VM
          switches can be specified in the society XML. A modified run
          script is not needed.  </ol>

<p> The <a href="design.html">design</a> of embedded Cougaar either
removes or replaces (with a trivial implementation) the standard
Node-level services. The choice of which services can be mixed and
matched and depend on the survivability requirements of the
society.

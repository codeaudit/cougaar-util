<title>Embedded Cougaar Design and Architecture</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>Design and Architecture</h2>

<p>The design of embedded Cougaar either removes or replaces (with a
trivial implementation) the standard Node-level services. Services
depend on jar files and sometimes config files. So the Embedded
Couggar installation will need all the files that will be used by the
society configuration. 

<p>The following subsystems can be reduced or eliminated:
<ul>

  <li> HTTP Logistics/Planning

  <li> HTTP Servlets

  <li> Communities

  <li> Yellow Pages

  <li> Message Transport Service

  <li> Metrics Service

  <li> Thread Service

  <li> Blackboard

  <li> Persistence
      
</ul>

<p> This writeup will use three example Embedded configurtions:
<ul>
  <li> Minimum Configuration: Replaces or removes all
      the standard services.
  <li> Standard Configuration: All standard services, without
      metrics, planning, and communities.
  <li> Metrics Configuration: Standard configuration with
      addition of Metrics service. 
</ul>

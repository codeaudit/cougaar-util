<h2>The Cougaar Frame Infrastructure: Code Generation</h2>

<p>Code generation for the Frame Infrastructure is handle by the class
  FrameGen. It reads an xml file in frameset.dtd format and generates
  a Java class for each prototype.  In addition it generates a dtd for
  the domain. It can also generate a uml file (.xmi) for the domain, as
	well as a Jess file (.clp) for the shadow classes if you want to
	write Jess rules that operate on frames.
</p>

<p>Several features of frameset.dtd are specifically there for the
  code generator, generally for efficiency but in some cases simply as
  useful information.  In the former category are most of the
  attributes on a <code>slot</code> element: type, default-value,
  member, immutable, notify-blackboard, notify-listeners, transient.
  Semantic details can be found the Frameset XML section.  In the
  latter category are the package and domain attributes of
  the <code>frameset</code> entity.
</p>

<p>The code generator could be extended to generate other things as
  well, including domain-specific runtime parsers for data frame xml
  files and domain-specific FrameSet classes.

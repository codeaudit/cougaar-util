<h2>The Cougaar Frame Infrastructure: Frameset XML</h2>

<p>FrameSets and Frames can be loaded into Cougaar via xml files.
  This section describes the XML elements and attributes for
  PrototypeFrames.  The formal description is in framesets.dtd.  The
  DTD format for the DataFrames of any particular domain is generated
  from the PrototypeFrames.  Those are not described in detail here,
  but in general each Prototype has a corresponding element that can
  contains elements for the slots in that Prototype.  Slot elements
  have only PCDATA for the value of the slot.  For an example, see
  cougaar-topology.dtd and test-frames.xml.

<dl>

  <dt><b>frameset</b></dt>

  <dd>A <code>frameset</code> element is used to describe a FrameSet.
    It has four required attributes.  The
    <code>frame-inheritance</code> describes the prototype inheritance
    structure.  The only supported value right now is "single" (i.e.,
    single inheritance).  The <code>container-relation</code>
    attribute specifies which relation prototype defines the
    containment hierarchy.  Any defined relation prototype can be
    specified here.  The <code>package</code> attribute is used by the
    code generator: the classes generated for this frameset's
    prototypes will be put in the given package and the files will be
    written to the corresponding directory stucture, following
    standard Java conventions.  The optional <code>index-slot</code>
    attribute can be used to specify a primary index for fast reverse
    lookup (ie, finding a frame by slot value).  The values of the given slot 
    within the frames of any given prototype should be unique, and for now
    the slot should be declared <code>immutable</code> (the latter
    restriction will probably be relaxed in a later release).  Providing
    an index slot will improve efficiency dramatically in large framesets
    particularly when the index is on the value slot of the frameset's container
    relation. Finally, the <code>domain</code>
    attribute specifies a name for whatever logical domain the
    framset's prototypes are describing.  This name should be the root
    element in xml data files for this domain.<p>

  </dd>

  <dt><b>copyright</b></dt>

  <dd>If a <code>copyright</code> element is present, its text is inserted at the top of
    of every generated .java file for this FrameSet.<p>
  </dd>

  <dt><b>prototypes</b></dt>

  <dd> A <code>prototypes</code> element can be used to group
    <code>prototype</code> elements.  It has no attributes and is
    not required.  Ordinarily a <code>prototypes</code> element would
    be within a <code>frameset</code> element in an XML file. But it
    can also be at the top level if the file is being read in to an
    existing FrameSet.<p>
    
  </dd>

  <dt><b>prototype</b></dt>

  <dd>A <code>prototype</code> element defines a PrototypeFrame.  It
    has one required attribute, <code>name</code>, which is the name of
    the prototype.  It also supports three optional attributes:
    <code>prototype</code>, which specifies the "super" of this one;
    <code>container</code>, which specifies the prototype of frames that
    can act as containers for frames of this prototype; and
    <code>doc</code>, which will be used as javadoc in the generated
    class.  The remaining structure of a prototype is specified by
    the <a href="#slot"><code>slot</code></a> elements it contains.
    <p>

  </dd>

  <dt><b>relation-prototype</b></dt>

  <dd>A <code>relation-prototype</code> element defines a
    PrototypeFrame representing a relationship.  The attributes
    are a superset of the attributes of <code>prototype</code>
    elements.  The additional attributes, all optional, are
    <code>parent-prototype</code>, <code>parent-slot</code>,
    <code>child-prototype</code> and <code>child-slot</code> </p>

  </dd>

  <dt><b>path</b></dt>

  <dd>A <code>path</code> element defines a <a href="#paths">Path</a>.
    It has one required attribute, <code>name</code>.  The elements it
    contains are any number of <code>forks</code> (order is
    significant) followed by an optional <code>slot-reference</code>.
    <p>

  </dd>


  <dt><b>fork</b></dt>

  <dd>A <code>fork</code> element defines a "hop" in its enclosing
  <code>path</code>, where a hop consists of a relation prototype and
  a role the next object on the path should play in that
  relationshoip.  Correspondingly, a <fork> element has two required
  attributes: <code>relation</code> (the relation prototype name) and
  <code>role</code> ("parent" or "child").<p>

  </dd>
  
  <a name="aggregate-by"></a><dt><b>aggregate-by</b></dt>
  
  <dd>An <code>aggregate-by</code> element is used to specify
	  that a slot value depends on an aggregate calculation
	  applied to a set of related entities.  The required attributes
	  are <code>relation</code> (the name of the relation prototype)
	  and <code>aggregator</code> (the name of a Java class that does the calculation).
	  The aggregator attribute must name a class that implements 
	  <code>org.cougaar.core.qos.frame.SlotAggregator</code>.  If the 
	  aggregator is not qualified with a package, it is assumed to be
	  in the same package as the frameset.
	  <p>If any related entities are added or deleted, the aggregator
	  is rerun automatically to compute a new value for the slot.  Similarly, if the
	  optional <code>child-slot</code> attribute is given and if that slot
	  is modified in a related entity, the aggregator
	  is rerun automatically on the related slot. <p></dd>
	  
	  
  <a name="slot"></a><dt><b>slot</b></dt>

  <dd> A <code>slot</code> element is used within
    <code>prototype</code> element to define one of the prototype's
    named fields. <code>Slot</code> elements have one required attribute, 
	  <code>name</code>, which
    is the name of the slot, and a range of optional attributes (see below).
	  They may also have an optional 
	  <a href="#aggregate-by"><code>aggregate-by</code></a> subelement.
    <p>
    <dl>

      <dt><code>doc</code></dt>

      <dd> This attribute provides optional
	documentation for the slot and is used as javadoc for the
	public accessor.  It's included in the slot metadata.
	<p>
      </dd>

      <dt><code>immutable</code></dt>

      <dd> This boolean valued attribute indicates whether or not
	the value of the slot in any given DataFrame can be chaged
	after initialization.  The default is "false" (ie, values
	can be changed after initialization).
	<p>
	
      </dd>
	  
      <dt><code>member</code></dt>

      <dd>This boolean valued attribute indicates whether or not the
	generated code for this slot treats it as a data member or
	as a property.  The former is more efficient for slots whose
	value is usually frame-specific, the latter is more
	efficient for slots whose value is usually defaulted. The
	default for this attribute is "true".
	
	<p>Other slot attributes can render this one irrelevant.  In
	particular, if a slot has a <code>path</code>, it will never
	be a data member, regardless of the setting of this
	attribute.  Conversely, if the slot is declared to have a
	simple <code>type</code>, or if it's declared to be
	<code>transient</code>, it will always be a data member,
	regardless of the setting of this attribute.

	<p>

      </dd>

      <dt><code>notify-blackboard</code></dt>

      <dd>This attribute specifies whether or not a change should be
	published on the Blackboard when the slot value changes.  The
	default is "true".  <p>

      </dd>

      <dt><code>notify-listeners</code></dt>

      <dd>This attribute specifies whether or not PropertyChange
	listeners should be notified when the slot value changes.  The
	default is "true".  <p>

      </dd>
      
      <dt><code>path</code></dt>

      <dd> The presence of this attribute indicates that the default
	value for this slot is computed by following a path.  The
	value of the attribute is the name of path.  If a
	<code>path</code> attribute is present, the slot cannot be a
	<code>member</code>.  <p>

      </dd>

      <dt><code>metric-path</code></dt>

      <dd> The presence of this attribute indicates that the
	value comes from the Metric Service dynamically.  The
	value of the attribute is a Metric Service path.  If a
	<code>metric-path</code> attribute is present, it implies
        that the slot is <code>read-only</code>, <code>member</code>
        and <code>transient</code>, and has <code>type</code>
        "Metric".
        <p>

      </dd>

	 <dt><code>inheritable-through</code></dt>

      <dd>This attribute indicates whether or not the
	corresponding data member should be hidden from containment 
		  inheritance.  Set to "prototype-only" to inhibit
		  containment inheritance.  The default is "false". <p>

      </dd>

		  
      <dt><code>transient</code></dt>

      <dd>This boolean valued attribute indicates whether or not the
	corresponding data member in the generated class will be
	declared transient.  The default is "false".  Transient
	slots are always <code>members</code>. <p>

      </dd>

      <dt><code>type</code></dt>

      <dd> This attribute is used to specify the Java type of values
	of this slot.  The default is "String".  Other possible values
	are "int", "long", "float", "double", "boolean", "Integer",
	"Long", "Float", "Double", "Boolean" and "Metric". Slots with
	simple types must be <code>members</code>. See below for more
	on slot types.<p>

      </dd>

      <dt><code>units</code></dt>

      <dd> This attribute provides optional units for the slot.  It's
	included in the slot metadata but currently isn't used for
	anything else.  <p> </dd>
	  
      <dt><code>default-value</code></dt>

      <dd>This attribute gives a default value of the slot.  The
	value can be any string.  If a slot has neither a value nor
	a path attribute, then the slot has no default value.  In
	this case, the generated accessor code will issue a warning
	if it has no frame-specific value for this slot.  <p>
      </dd>

      <dt><code>warn</code></dt>

      <dd>This boolean valued attribute indicates whether or not a
	warning is generated at runtime if the slot has no
	value. The default for this attribute is "true".  <p>

      </dd>


    </dl>

  </dd>

  <dt><b>slot-reference</b></dt>

  <dd>A <code>slot-reference</code> element can only be used within a
    <code>path</code> element, and if present, must be the last element
    in the <code>path</code>.  It simply names a slot.  As such it has
    one required attribute, <code>name</code>.
    <p>

  </dd>

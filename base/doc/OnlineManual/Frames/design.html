<h2>The Cougaar Frame Infrastructure: Design</h2>

<p>A FrameSet in the Cougaar Frame Infrastructure is specified by a
  set of <i>PrototypeFrames</i>, which define the data types; and
  prototype inheritance specification; and a containment
  specification, which indicates which of the relation prototypes
  should define the containment hierarchy.  A FrameSet, in other
  words, is defines a <i>domain</i> in the form of a dual hierarchy of
  types. It also implicitly defines a <i>namespace</i> of types. For
  now we support only single-inheritance along both hierarchies.  The
  FrameSet has the responsiblity for handling per-prototype frame
  instantiation, as well as caching for efficient handling of
  relationship frames.
</p>

<p>To facilitate instantiation, and also to increase the run time
  efficiency of slot lookups, a code generator generates a Java class
  for each PrototypeFrame.  It is these classes that are instantiated
  for the <i>DataFrames</i>.  Most generated classes extend another
  generated class: its parent in the prototype hierarchy.  There are
  also two root prototypes in each domain, with no explicit parent:
  the root entity prototype, which is generated such that it directly
  extends DataFrame, and the root relation prototype, which extends
  the predefined class RelationFrame (in turn an extension of
  DataFrame).
</p>

<p>The PrototypeFrame instances are kept at runtime in the FrameSet,
  along with the DataFrames.  Although in principle all the necessary
  information could be generated in advance, thereby avoiding any need
  to represent Prototypes directly at runtime, in practice it's useful
  to keep this meta-data available in the form of first-class
  Objects. On the other hand, PrototypeFrame instances are completely
  fixed at runtime: nothing about them can change.  DataFrames are
  fixed only to the extent that their prototype can't change.
  Otherwise they're fully dynamic objects.
</p>

<p>FrameSets can be created and populated via xml using the
  <b>FrameSetService</b>, which can also be used to find existing
  FrameSets.  See xxx.
</p>

<p> <a name="containment"></a> One of the novel features of the
  Cougaar frame system is that it supports two independent
  hierarchies. In addition to the prototype hierarchy, the Cougaar
  frame system a second single-inheritance hierarchy known as
  <i>containment</i>. Containment is a special relationship used to
  augment slot value lookup at runtime.  As one might expect,
  DataFrames can include a frame-specific value for any given slot.
  If it does, no further work is required.  If it doesn't, the
  prototype hierarchy is searched for a default value or for a path
  specification (see <a href="#paths">below</a> for more on paths).
  If this fails as well, the containment hierarchy can then be
  searched.  This allows a DataFrame to have virtual access to slots
  defined by its logical container.  The containment relation is
  defined as part of FrameSet and fixed when the FrameSet is created.
  This relation is an example of caching handled by the FrameSet. 
</p>

<a name="paths"></a> 
<p>Another novel features of the Cougaar frame system is
  the <i>Path</i> specification.  The description of any given slot in
  a prototype can indicate that the value of that slot for some frame
  F is determined by following a particular path from F a runtime.  A
  Path represents a kind of encapsulated visitor pattern.  It consists
  of an ordered series of <i>Forks</i> and a slot.  Each Fork refers
  to a relation and a role.  This allows any given frame to follow a
  path, one relationship at a time, to any related frame, arbitrarily
  far away.  When the final frame in the path is reached, the given
  slot value is returned as the value of the original slot
  reference. NB: Although DataFrames generally act like beans,
  including property-change support, Path-valued slots are an
  exception at the moment: if the value of Path-valued slot changes,
  listeners will not be notified. We hope to deal with this in a
  future release.

    <h2>The Cougaar Frame Infrastructure: Architecture</h2>



    <p>A <i>Frame</i> is a basic unit of knowledge, consisting of a
      collection of named <i>slots</i>, each of which can have a
      value.  A <i>FrameSet</i> is an organized collection of Frames.
      The organization of any particular FrameSet is itself defined by
      a special subset of the Frames it contains.  These metadata
      Frames are known as <i>PrototypeFrames</i>, while ordinary data
      in the FrameSet takes the form of <i>DataFrames</i>. Each
      DataFrame is an instance of a exactly one prototype, and can
      represent either a logical entity, or to binary relationships
      between entities.  The importance of this distinction will
      become clear later.
    </p>

    <p>PrototypeFrames define the slots that are included in
      DataFrames of the corresponding prototype (or of a descendent of
      that prototype).  The definition of a slot has a number of
      dimensions, some of which are conceptual (eg the value type) and
      some of which are more like implementation pragmas (eg whether
      or not the slot should be represented as a data member in a Java
      class).
    </p>

    <p>One somewhat unusual feature of slots is that their value can
      be specified as a <i>path</i> through the FrameSet.  A Path is a
      first-class object in the specification of a FrameSet, and
      describes an ordered series of relative steps a given Frame
      should follow in order to find the current value of a
      path-valued slot.

    <p>The PrototypeFrames in any given FrameSet are arranged as
      single-inheritance hierarchy, much like the class hierarchy in
      Java.  In addition, the Cougaar Frame System supports a second,
      independent hierarchy, known as <i>containment</i>, which for
      each FrameSet is defined a particular relation prototype.  These
      two hierarchies can be thought of very loosely as "is a" and "is
      contained in", though the doesn't necessarily represent physical
      containment.  Slots are fully inherited through the prototype
      hierarchy and inherited read-only through the containment
      hierarchy.

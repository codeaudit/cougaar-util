  <h2>The Cougaar Frame Infrastructure: Overview</h2>

  <body>

    <p>The Cougaar Frame Infrastructure provides a lightweight and
      efficiently distributed form of knowledge representation
      supporting two independent inheritance hierarchies, path
      following, and code generation.  The specification of a given
      set of frame definitions (prototypes) includes not only
      conceptual information for whatever domain the frames are being
      used to represent, but also implementation hints to maximize
      efficiency.  This allows the designer to fine-tune the
      definitions in a way that's not generally available in other
      frame systems.
    </p>

    <p>Frames are Blackboard objects: new Frames and changes to Frames
      are published to a Blackboard associated with the FrameSet.
      Frames are also Java Beans, and can therefore be used by some
      rule engines (eg Jess, the Java Expert System Shell) in the
      pattern matching of the left-hand-side of a rule.  Much of the
      power of the Cougaar Frame infrastructure comes from this
      unification between Frames in a knowedge base, entities on a
      Blackboard and facts in a rule engine.
    </p>

    <p>For increased efficiency, Frames are organized into collectons
      called FrameSets.  FrameSets are used to cache relationships
      between Frames, in particular the containment relation. FrameSets
      also provide an implicit namespace of types.

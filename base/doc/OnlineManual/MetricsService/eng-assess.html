<h2>Engineering Assessment</h2>

<p>
<h2> Null Metrics Service </h2>

For engineering assessment, it is possible to configure the metric service to add or remove functionality. 
The assessment idea is to remove as much functionality as possible to obtain a base line. The functionality 
is then added back piece by piece and the system is re-evalutate to determine the overhead.
</p>
<p>
The first level of testing is to remove the metrics service sensors and clients. To remove the clients of the 
service, the metrics rules should not be loaded into the society XML. Past measurements show that the metric 
service clients and less than 10% load on a Node.
</p>
<p>
Another level of base-lining is to remove the metric-service implementation itself. The Metric Service is really 
a wrapper around the QuO Resource Status Service. If the RSS class is not found, the wrapper will act as a blackhole. 
The <code>MetricsService</code> will accept subscriptions, queries, but the wrapper will always return a NO-VALUE Metric. 
Also, <code>MetricsUpdaterService</code> can input with key-value pairs, but the wrapper will just drop them.<br>
The empty implementation of <code>MetricsService</code> returns a 0-credibility metric with the provenance set to "undefined"
(this constant <code>MetricImpl.UndefinedMetric</code>) for all <code>getValue</code> calls and does nothing for all 
<code>subscribeToValue</code> and <code>unsubscribeToValue</code> calls.   
The empty implementation of <code>MetricsUpdateService</code> does nothing for the <code>updateValue</code> call. 
<br>
Of course none of the Metrics clients will work, and should not be configured in the society XML.
</p>
<p>
In 11.0 you can disable the QuO-RSS implementation, getting empty implementations of the MetricsService and the 
MetricsUpdateService, if qos.jar isn't accessible. Simply remove the quoSumo.jar from the Class path <code>$CIP/sys/qouSumo.jar</code>.
<br>
In subsequent releases you get empty implementations of the MetricsService and the MetricsUpdateService by loading 
the component <code>org.cougaar.core.qos.metrics.MetricsServiceProvider</code>. Full Component-loading isn't functional in 11.0,
so provided is a workaround to do this with a -D flag: <br><br>
<code>-Dorg.cougaar.society.xsl.param.metrics=trivial</code>.

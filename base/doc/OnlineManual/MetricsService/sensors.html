<h1>Adding New Metrics to the Metrics Service</h1>
<p>
The Metrics Package has helper classes for collecting raw sensor
values, converting them into metrics, adding them into the path
model, and displaying them in a servlet. In this section, we
explain how these helper classes can be used to add new metrics to
the Metrics Service. 

<p>
The Metric Service gets its data from several sources and integrates
them into a up-to-date picture of the environment in which the Node
finds itself. There are three ways of originating data into the Metrics Service,
these are:
<ul>
  <li>Sensor data from Cougaar code measures the internal consumption
      of resource by Agents and Nodes. For example, the number of
      messages sent by an Agent or the amount of CPU or memory
      consumed by an Agent</li>
  <li>Network Management Configuration Files are used to get
      information about network characteristics from external Network
      Management Systems.</li>
  <li>Host Level probes are used to measure the characteristics of the
      Node's host </li>
</ul>

<p> All these sources of data use the same "patterns" for capturing
and processing the data. The processing of Metrics can be described as
a data flow, which is processed by different components. Each
component does a different job in converting raw sensor data into
usable metrics.  <a href="#SensorDataFlow"><i>Figure</i></a>.
represents the processing of data as it flows through the Metrics
Service:

<ul>
  <li><b>Sensors</b> instrument the system and store raw statistics
      records. The records can be accessed via a service, which takes
      a snapshot of the record.
  <li><b>Rate-Converters</b> gathers snapshots of sensor records and
      converts them into metrics. The metrics are published into the
      Metrics service
  <li><b>Metrics Service</b> models the environment. Internal to the
      model, formulas can depend on the raw metrics that are published into
      the Metrics service. The formulas can be accessed from the
      metrics service using paths.
  <li><b>QoS Adaptive Components</b> use the Metrics Service
      environment model to adapt to the Node's processing to changes
      in the environment. 
  <li><b>Servlets</b> are used to view both Metrics and raw sensor records.
</ul>
<p>	  
The patterns used to create these components are described in the
following sections. Some explanations of this process are more easily understood
when referencing specific pieces of the code, which will be
highlighted in <font color="006633">green</font> for emphasis.

<h4>Sensor </h4>
<p>
Sensors have probes in the critical path of the basic operation of
the Node. The probes must have very little overhead, so they have
limited functionality. Probes only have time to detect that an event has
happened and tally the results in a statistics record. The record
holds many raw sensor values. There are 3 kinds of
raw sensors values, which can reside in either
the code or host probes.  which are:
<ul> <li> <b><i>Gauge</i></b>: This is an instantaneous value, such as
    utilization, current resource
    capacity.  </li>
<li> <b><i>Counter</i></b>: Continuously increments
    some value like MsgsIn/Out or BytesIn/Out.  <font
    color="006633">org.cougaar.mts.std.AgentStatusAspect</font> is an
    example of such a Sensor, continuously counting the MsgIn/Out &
    BytesIn/Out for local agents of a node, and the sums for the node
    itself. <font
    color="006633">org.cougaar.core.qos.metrics.AgentLoadServlet</font>
    is one gui where they user can observe this data.</li>
<li>
    <b><i>Integrator</i></b>: Counter that is a weighted summation of
    delta t * the value in that period.  Integrators are used find the
    average value of gauge values over a time period. For example,
    Agent's CPU consumption is measured by the average number of
    threads used to process the Agent's code. (This is call the
    Agent's Load Average)
    <font  color="006633">org.cougaar.core.thread.AgentLoadSensorPlugin</font>
    is an example of such a Sensor, continuously counting the
    MsgIn/Out & BytesIn/Out for local agents of a node, and the sums
    for the node itself.  </li>
</ul>
<p>
An external clients of the Sensor component can sample the statistics
record using a service offered by the Sensor. 
When a client samples data, it takes a <b>Snapshot</b> at a
point in time, resulting in a collection of these snapshots which need
to be processed to create usable Metrics. Notice the processing of
the raw statistics is not done as part of the critical path, but done by
an independent component with its own threads. The processing of
snapshots is the subject of the next section.

<h4>Rate Conversion </h4>
<p>
Rate converter are clients to a sensor service and periodically take
snapshots of the sensors record. The two snapshots are processed to
create meaningful metrics. The time between snapshots defines the
averaging interval for the metric. The processing is different for each field
in the record, depending on the kind of sensor value. For example to calculate
rate of messages being sent by an agent, the sensor value for the
count of messages from the agent is needed. The change in count is
subtracted from two snapshots and the change in time is subtracted
from the snapshot timestamps. The message rate is calculated by
dividing the change in count by the change in time.
<p> Rate converters have the following internal structure:
<ul>
  <li>
      <b><i>Record Processing</i></b>: Data snapshots are collated and
      computed as a rolling average of changes in time & value. A 
      Decaying History object is used to store the snapshots and call
      the record processing.
  </li>
  <li>    
      <b><i>Decaying History</i></b>: Is an object which coordinates
      the storage and processing of snapshots. It maintains a decay
      stor of snapshots and call the processing of data snapshots for
      several averaging periods.( 10, 100, 1000-second averages are
      common).
      <font color="006633"> org.cougaar.core.qos.metrics.AgentStatusRatePlugin</font>
      is one plugin which implements the DecayingHistory's <font
      color="006633">newAddition()</font>, which updates the
      Metrics Service with the processed value. 
  </li>
  <li>
      <b><i>Key generation</i></b>: After the snapshots are processed and
      represent a value per some time duration, a <a href="keys.html">Key</a> is generated in
      relation to the rolling average of time, and used to insert this
      Metric into the Metrics Service. 
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Metrics Service Models</h4>
The Metrics Service maintains a model of the environment for the
Cougaar society. The model includes contexts for the Hosts, Nodes,
and Agents in the society. Each Node maintains its own instance of
the model and updates it using Metrics published into the Metrics
Updater Service. 

<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Resource Context</b>: model a specific entity in the
  environment. Resource Contexts can contain child contexts. The
  children inherit all the attributes of its parent. For example, an
  Agent context is a child of Node, which is a child of Host. The
  Agent has a CPU count attribute that it inherits from its Host.
  <font color="006633">
  org.cougaar.core.qos.rss.AgentDS</font> is an example of a Resource
  Context. 
  </li>
      
  <li><b>Formula</b>: calculate attributes of a context. Formulas may
      depend on other formulas or raw Metrics published to the Metrics
      service. The
      <font color="006633">
      org.cougaar.core.qos.rss.DecayingHistoryFormula</font> is a helper
      class which create formulas that get their values directly from
      Metrics published by a Decaying History object. 
  </li>
      
  <li><b>IntegatorDS</b> integrate published metrics from many
      DataFeeds into a single value. Resource Contexts Formulas get the
      values for published Metrics by subscribing to Integrator formulas,
      instead of getting the Metrics directly from the feeds themselves.
      The IntegratorDS is part of the QuO RSS, which is outside of
      the Cougaar code. 
  </li>
</ul>
  

<h4> Metrics Servlet</h4>

<p>
Evaluating the Metrics Service & Observing the system is usually done
through GUIs in the Cougaar system, using Cougaar Servlets. In the
Metrics Service, there resides many differnent servlets pertaining to
communications, resource constraints, etc., please refer to <a
href="operation.html" target="contents">Operation Using Servlets</a>
for the different kinds of servlets currently available. 

<p>
Metrics Servlets all extend a Metrics Servlet template, which is
formatted to make easy interpretation of the Metrics with tables,
background & text colors. Here's a quick guide to interpreting a
Metrics Servlet: Refer to the servlet page or the picture below for a
visual. 

<ul>
<li><b>query</b>: This is a servlet window into the Metrics Service,
    or when a servlet is queried it reveals a current snapshot of
    those current Metrics Service values. </li> 
 <li><b>Value</b>: Dislayed as the base text, this is the Metrics name
     (e.g. AgentA Load)</li>
 <li><b>Credibility</b>: Displayed as the color of the text: light gray
     to indicate that the metric value was only determined as a
     compile-time default; gray to indicate that the metric value was
     obtained from a configuration file; black to indicate that the
     metric value was obtained from a run-time measurement.
     A metric's credibility metric is an approximate measure of how
     much to believe that the value is true. Credibility takes into
     account several factors, including when, how, by whom a
     measurement was made.
 </li>
 <li><b>threshold</b>: Displayed in the credibility, and when this
     this certain Metric's value crosses a threshold, it may be
     interesting enough to warrant attention. This is shown by the
     color of the background. A green background indicates that
     the value is in the normal range. A yellow background
     indicates that the values is in a typical ground state, i.e
     nothing is happening. A red background indicates that the
     value has crossed a metric-specific threshold and may be
     interesting.
 </li>
</ul>

<h4>Sensor Servlet</h4>
Sensor Servlets allow viewing of a raw sensor servlet. The main use
of sensor servlets is for debugging. 

<h4>QoS Adaptive Components</h4>
QoS Adaptive components subscribe to Metrics using the Metrics
Service. How to create QoS Adaptive Components is out of scope for
this section. 

<h4>Constants</h4>
<p>
The same name for a metric must be used throughout all components of
the metrics service. To aid consistency, we recommend using the
metrics constants.  The list of constants is documented in <font
color="006633">org.coguaar.core.qos.metrics.Constants</font> 
<ul>
  <li><b>Metrics Name</b>: Quite obviously, the name of the Metric, as
      it applies to its measurement & key generation. Ususally, <font
      color="006633">CPU_LOAD_AVG, CPU_LOAD_MJIPS, MSG_IN, MSG_OUT, BYTES_IN, BYTES_OUT</font>
      </li>
  <li><b>Averaging intervals</b>: Used in the Key of a Metric,
      referring to the averaging interval of value to time of that
      value. The current intervals are:  <font color="006633">1_SEC_AVG, 10_SEC_AVG,
      100_SEC_AVG, 1000_SEC_AVG</font>.  
  </li>
</ul>

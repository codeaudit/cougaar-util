<h2>org.cougaar.core.qos.metrics.MetricNotificationQualifier</h2>

<p>

This qualifier is used to restrict the frequency of callbacks, for
example by specifying the smallest change that should trigger one. The
qualifier is used as part of the Metrics Service subscribeToValue()
method, an instance is given for each subscription. In order to filter
the notifications, the MetricsNotificationQualifier will need some
state, such as the value of the last notification.

<h2>Servlets</h2>

<p>
Cougaar includes optional servlet components to display metrics
data in a browser.  These servlets can be used to:<ul>
  <li>View the real-time performance of the society, such as
  CPU load and message traffic,</li>
  <li>Debug a running application, for example to find blocked
  messages, and</li>
  <li>Illustrate more complex examples of the basic metrics service
  <a href="usecases.html">usage patterns</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The servlets are documented in more detail <a href="#detail">below</a>.
Here is a brief summary of the servlets, in order of most common use by
developers:

<ul>
  <li><nobr>
      <a href="#metrics_agent_load">/metrics/agent/load</a>
      &nbsp;[<a href="agent-load-servlet.html">snapshot</a>]:</nobr><br>
      Current top-level view of the CPU load, message traffic, and
      persistence activity of all agents on the node.</li>
  <li><nobr>
      <a href="#metrics_host_resources">/metrics/host/resources</a>
      &nbsp;[<a href="node-resources-servlet.html">snapshot</a>]:</nobr><br>

      &nbsp;[<a href="../ThreadService/operation.html">snapshot</a>]:</nobr><br>
      Although not a metrics servlet per-se, the thread service's
      "top" servlet displays running and queued pooled threads.</li>
  <li><nobr>
      <a href="#message_statistics">/message/statistics</a>
      &nbsp;[<a href="message-statistics-servlet.html">snapshot</a>]:</nobr><br>
      Cumulative message traffic by the node (aggregate of all agents
      on that node), plus a message size histogram.</li>
  <li><nobr>
      <a href="#message_between_Any_agent_and_Local_Agent">/message/between-Any-agent-and-Local-Agent?agent=<i>AGENT</i></a>
      &nbsp;[<a href="local-agents-servlet.html">snapshot</a>]:</nobr><br>
      Cumulative message traffic by the specified local agent to/from
      any target.</li>
  <li><nobr>
      <a href="#message_between_Node_and_Agent">/message/between-Node-and-Agent?agent=<i>AGENT</i></a>
      &nbsp;[<a href="remote-agents-servlet.html">snapshot</a>]:</nobr><br>
      Cumulative message traffic by the node (aggregate of all agents on
      that node) to/from the specified target agent.</li>
  <li><a href="#metrics_query">/metrics/query?paths=<i>PATHS</i></a>:<br>
      Read raw metric(s) as XML.</li>
  <li><a href="#metrics_writer">/metrics/writer?key=<i>KEY</i>&value=<i>VALUE</i></a>:<br>
      Write a raw metric into the metrics service.</li>
</ul>

<p> The rest of this section describes each servlet in more detail:

<dl>
  <a name="message_between_Any_agent_and_Local_Agent"/>
  <dt><h3>/message/between-Any-agent-and-Local-Agent</h3></dt>

  <dd>This servlet displays status of communications from an agent on
    this node to ALL other agents in the society.  The servlet is a
    dump of the RAW contents of the Agent Status Service and does not
    use the Metrics Service. Click <a
    href="local-agents-servlet.html">here</a> for a sample
    display. <p>
  </dd>

  <a name="message_between_Node_and_Agent"/>
  <dt><h3>/message/between-Node-and-Agent</h3></dt>

  <dd>This servlet displays status of communications from ALL agents
          on this node to a specified agent.  The servlet is a
	  dump of the RAW contents of the Agent Status Service and
	  does not use the Metrics Service.  Click <a
	  href="remote-agents-servlet.html">here</a> for a sample
	  display. <p>
  </dd>

  <a name="message_statistics"/>
  <dt><h3>/message/statistics</h3></dt>

  <dd>This servlet summarizes the Messages statistics for
      communications out of all agents on this node. This is a raw
      dump of the legacy MTS Message Statistics Service and does not
      use the Metrics service. Click <a
      href="message-statistics-servlet.html">here</a> for a sample
      display. <p>
  </dd>
  
  <a name="metrics_agent_load"/>
  <dt><h3>/metrics/agent/load</h3></dt>
      
  <dd>This servlet shows the amount of resource consumption for each
    agent and service that is resident to this node. The resources
    include CPU, Communications, and Storage. This servlet is used to
    see which agents are resident on the node and their level of
    activity. The metrics are all average rates over the averaging
    interval. Click <a href="agent-load-servlet.html">here</a> for a
    sample display.<p>
  </dd>

  <a name="metrics_host_resources"/>
  <dt><h3>/metrics/host/resources</h3></dt>
      
  <dd>This servlet shows the status of Host resources for the Node.
      The most of basic values come from polling  Linux /proc. MJIPS
      (Million Java Instructions per Second) comes from running
      benchmark.  Click <a
      href="node-resources-servlet.html">here</a> for a sample
      display. <p>
  </dd>

  <a name="metrics_query"/>
  <dt><h3>/metrics/query</h3></dt>

  <dd>This servlet allows the operator to query the MetricsService
      directly.  The result can either be displayed as a web page as
      XML or returned to the invoker as serialized Java HashMap,
      depending on the value of the <code>format</code> uri
      argument.  One or more query <a href="paths.html"
      target="contents">paths</a> should be supplied as the value of
      the <code>paths</code> uri argument, with <code>|</code> as the
      separator. <p>
      <p>
       Usage:  <br>
        "http://localhost:8800/$nodename/metrics/query?format=xml&paths=Agent(3-69-ARBN):Jips|Agent(3-69-ARBN):CPULoadJips10SecAvg" 
	</p>
	<p>	
	The 'format' argument is optional, but if left out defaults to xml return of metric data to the browser. <br>
	An optional Java version of a metrics query client was written and resides in 
	<a href="exampleMetricsQueryClient.html">core/examples/org/cougaar/core/examples/metrics/ExampleMetricQueryClient</a>, 
	returning a hashmap of path values from	the query-specified node.
      </p>
  </dd>

 
  <a name="metrics_remote_agents"/>
  <dt><h3>/metrics/remote/agents</h3></dt>

  <dd>This servlet shows the status of resources along the path for
      communications from any agent on the node to a specific
      agent. This servlet is useful for debugging. For example, if the
      Queue length is greater than one, then messages are backed up
      waiting to be transmitted to the agent. Since messages are
      usually sent right away this indicates a problem along the
      path. Likewise, if he Node has not HeardFrom an agent recently,
      the agent or its node may have failed.  Also, the table show the
      capacity of the network path to the agent and the agent's host
      capacity.  Click <a href="remote-status-servlet.html">here</a>
      for a sample display.  <p>
  </dd>


  <a name="metrics_writer"/>
  <dt><h3>/metrics/writer</h3></dt>

  <dd>This servlet allows the operator to write values into the
      MetricsService directly. The <code>key</code> and
      <code>value</code> should be supplied with uri arguments of the
      same name.  For now the value must be parseable as a double.
      The metric will be entered with USER_DEFAULT_CREDIBILITY (0.3)
      and with the client host as the provenance. <p>
      <p>
      Usage:  <br>
      Specified by a prefix of protocol, host, port, nodename and path, followed by some key-value pair in the usual http::get 
      parameter format. <br>
      e.g.: <br>
      "http://localhost:8800/$nodename/metrics/writer/?key=Site_Flow_10.200.2.0/24_10.200.4.0/16_Capacity_Max&value=5600" <br>
      </p>
      
  </dd>
      

</dl>


<h2>GUI Conventions</h2>

<p> Several metrics servlets uses gui conventions to show three
attributes of each metric. In addition, some are mouse sensitive: all
the metric's attributes are displayed on the browser's documentation
line.

<p> The <b>value</b> of the metric is displayed as the base text.

<p>The <b>credibility</b> of the metric is displayed as the color of
the text: light gray to indicate that the metric value was only
determined as a compile-time default; gray to indicate that the metric
value was obtained from a configuration file; black to indicate that
the metric value was obtained from a run-time measurement. A metric's
credibility metric is an approximate measure of how much to believe
that the value is true. Credibility takes into account several
factors, including when, how, by whom a measurement was made.

<p> When the value of a metric crosses a <b>threshold</b>, its value
may be interesting enough to warrant attention.  This is shown by the
color of the background. A green background indicates that the value
is in the normal range. A yellow background indicates that the values
is in a typical ground state, i.e nothing is happening. A red
background indicates that the value has crossed a metric-specific
threshold and may be interesting.

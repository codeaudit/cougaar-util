<title>Metrics Service Configuration</title>
</head>

<body>


<h2>Configuration</h2>
The Metrics Service is made of many components all of which are
optional. If no components are added the Metrics Service will act as
a black-hole with MetricsUpdates writing, but no call-backs or queries
returned from the MetricsService (reader). The following types of
components can be configured. The specific components are listed in
the following sections along with their function, insertion point and
module (jarfile).

<h3> Metrics Servlets </h3>
The following components allow viewing of Metrics through servlets.
(See   <a href="operation.html" target="contents">
	    Using Metrics Servlets</a>). The components are in
core.jar and should be loaded into the NodeAgent.

<dl>
  <dt>
      org.cougaar.core.qos.metrics.MetricsServletPlugin"
  </dt>
  <dd>Loads the Metric Service Servlets, which are:
      AgentLoadServlet,
      RemoteAgentServlet,
      NodeResourcesServlet,
      MetricQueryServlet,
      MetricsWriterServlet,
  </dd>
</dl>


<h3> CPU Load Components </h3>
The following components collect metrics about the CPU
consumption of Agents. The components are in
core.jar and should be loaded into the NodeAgent.
<dl>
   <dt>
       org.cougaar.core.thread.AgentLoadSensorPlugin
  </dt>
  <dd>
      Sensor for measuring the CPU load for Agents.
  </dd>
  <dt>
      org.cougaar.core.thread.AgentLoadRatePlugin
  </dt>
  <dd>
      Converts the raw CPU sensor measurements into Metrics
  </dd>

   <dt>
      org.cougaar.core.thread.TopPlugin
  </dt>
  <dd>servlet for viewing running threads (TopServlet). Also loads the RogueThreadDetector.
  </dd>


</dl>

<h3> Message Load Components </h3>
The following component collect metrics about the message traffic
into and out of Agents. The components are in the mtsstd.jar and
should be load at the insertion point Node.AgentManager.Agent.MessageTransport.Component
<dl>
   <dt>
       org.cougaar.core.qos.metrics.AgentStatusAspect
  </dt>
  <dd>
  Sensor for Measuring the message flow into and out of Agents
      (This Aspect is always loaded in the Base template)
  </dd>
  <dt>
      org.cougaar.mts.std.StatisticsAspect
  </dt>
  <dd>
      Sensor for measuring the size of messages
  </dd>
  <dt>
      org.cougaar.core.qos.metrics.AgentStatusRatePlugin
  </dt>
  <dd>
       Converts the raw message sensor measurements into Metrics
  </dd>
  <dt>
      org.cougaar.mts.std.StatisticsPlugin
  </dt>
  <dd> Servlet for viewing raw message sensor counters, which include:
      StatisticsServlet, AgentRemoteStatusServlet, AgentLocalStatusServlet
  </dd>
</dl>


<h3> Agent Mobility and QuO Components </h3>
The following Components pull the topology service to detect when
Nodes and Agents move. Also, they offer a service for QuO Sysconds to
subscribe to Metrics. They should be loaded in the insertion point Node.AgentManager.Agent.MetricsServices.Component
<dl>
  <dt>
      org.cougaar.core.qos.rss.AgentHostUpdaterComponent  
  </dt>
  <dd>
      Periodically polls the topology service and updates the internal
      Metric Service models to keep the Host-Node-Agent containment
      hierarchy up to date.
  </dd>
  <dt>
      org.cougaar.lib.mquo.SyscondFactory 
  </dt>
  <dd>
      Factory for creating QuO Sysconds which track Metrics.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3> Persistence Size  Components </h3>
The follow component measure the memory consumption of Agents.
These components are in the core.jar and need to be loaded into every
Agent. 
<dl>
  <dt>
   org.cougaar.core.qos.metrics.PersistenceAdapterPlugin"  
  </dt>
  <dd>
      Sensor for measuring the Agent persistence size.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3> Gossip Components </h3>
The gossip subsystem disseminates metrics between nodes. (See   <a href="gossip.html" target="contents">
	    Using Metrics Servlets</a>). The components are in
qos.jar 
<dl>
  <dt>
      org.cougaar.core.qos.gossip.GossipAspect
  </dt>
  <dd>
      Piggybacks Metric requests and Metric Values on messages.
      Load at the insertion point Node.AgentManager.Agent.MessageTransport.Component
  </dd>
  <dt>
      org.cougaar.core.qos.gossip.SimpleGossipQualifierComponent
  </dt>
  <dd>
      Limits which Metrics should be requested or value forwarded
       Load at the insertion point Node.AgentManager.Agent.MessageTransport.Component
  </dd>
  <dt>
      org.cougaar.core.qos.gossip.GossipFeedComponent
  </dt>
  <dd>
      Metrics Service Feed for updating metrics from remote Nodes.  Load at the insertion point Node.AgentManager.Agent.MetricService.Component
  </dd>
  <dt>
      org.cougaar.core.qos.gossip.GossipStatisticsServiceAspect
  </dt>
  <dd> Collects gossip overhead statistics
       Load at the insertion point Node.AgentManager.Agent.MessageTransport.Component
  </dd>
  <dt>
      org.cougaar.core.qos.gossip.GossipStatisticsPlugin
  </dt>
  <dd> Load Servlet for viewing Gossip overhead statistics.
       Load at the insertion point Node.AgentManager.Agent.MessageTransport.Component
  </dd>
</dl>


<h3>RSS-Resource Status Service</h3>
The Metric Service need access to configuration files to define
the expected network and host capacity. The
Metrics-Sites.conf file is required and
the Metrics-Defaults.conf file is optional. Example files are
in the overlay at .../configs/rss or source in in qos/configs/rss.
Also, the data feed with the name "sites" has the special purpose of
defining the sites themselves (i.e.subnet masks),
so other Metrics Keys should not be put in this conf file.
<p> The cougaarconfig: url scheme means the files are on the cougaar
config path. Otherwise, the url is normal and will just down load the
conf files. Putting the configuration files on a web server is useful
for a cougaar applications which run at a site with a complicated
topology. Also, Network and Host management systems can update the
files with real data. (Note the conf files are down-loaded only once
at startup)
<dl>
  <dt>
      org.cougaar.core.qos.rss.ConfigFinderDataFeedComponent
  </dt>
  <dd> Two Components should be loaded with the following parameters
      <br><code> "name=sites","url=cougaarconfig:Metrics-Sites.conf" </code>
      <br><code> "name=hosts","url=cougaarconfig:Metrics-Defaults.conf"</code>
      
      The insertion point is Node.AgentManager.Agent.MetricsServices.Component
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2> Acme Scripts </h2>
Acme rule scripts are available for loading the Metrics Service.
The rules are in directory
<code>qos/csmart/config/rules/metrics</code>. The
<code>rule.txt</code> list the recommended rules to load the standard
Metrics Service. Addition rules must be added in order to measure the
length of messages (serialization) and setup the network/host
configuration files (rss). The rule directories have the following purpose:
<dl>
  <dt>
      <code>sensors</code>
  </dt>
      
  <dd> Adds servlets that look at the raw sensors. These rules do
  not load any of the Metrics Service runtime, so they should not impact
  performance. These rules are useful for debugging and we
  recommended that they should alway be loaded. 
  </dd>

  <dt>
      <code>basic </code>
  </dt>
  <dd> Loads the basic Metrics Service which includes some
      potentially high overhead components, such as the
      Agent-to-Agent traffic matrix and Gossip.
  </dd>

      <dt>
      <code>serialization </code>
  </dt>
  <dd> 
      The basic MTS serialization rule for measures message
      length. This rule conflicts with other serialization rules,
      such as bandwidth measurement, security, and compression. These
      other aspects must be loaded in a specific order which is
      explained in the <code>metrics-only-serialization.rule</code>
      Only one serialization rule should be loaded. 
  </dd>
      <dt>
      <code> rss </code>
  </dt>
  <dd> 
      Supplying network and host configuration data to the RSS is
      very network specific. Each test site has its own rules which
      tap into the local sources of system information. If you are
      running at the TIC, you should load the rules in <code>rss/tic</code>
  </dd>

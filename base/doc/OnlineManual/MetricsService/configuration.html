<title>Metrics Service Configuration</title>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
The Metrics Service is made of many components all of which are
optional. If no components are added the Metrics Service will act as
a black-hole with MetricsUpdates writing, but no call-backs or queries
returned from the MetricsService (reader). The following types of
components can be configured. The specific components are listed in
the following sections along with their function,  insertion point and
module (jarfile).

<h3> Acme Scripts </h3>
Acme rule scripts are available for loading the Metrics Service.
The rules are in directory
<code>isat/csmart/config/rules/metrics</code>. The
<code>rule.txt</code> list the recommended rules to load the standard
Metrics Service. Addition rules must be added in order to measure the
length of messages (serialization) and setup the network/host
configuration files (rss). The rule directories have the following purpose:
<dl>
  <dt>
      <code>sensors</code>
  </dt>
      
  <dd> Adds servlets that look at the raw sensors. These rules do
  not load any of the Metrics Service runtime, so they should not impact
  performance. These rules are useful for debugging and we
  recommended that they should alway be loaded. 
  </dd>

  <dt>
      <code>basic </code>
  </dt>
  <dd> Loads the basic Metrics Service which includes some
      potentially high overhead components, such as the
      Agent-to-Agent traffic matrix and Gossip.
  </dd>

      <dt>
      <code>serialization </code>
  </dt>
  <dd> 
      The basic MTS serialization rule for measures message
      length. This rule conflicts with other serialization rules,
      such as bandwidth measurement, security, and compression. These
      other aspects must be loaded in a specific order which is
      explained in the <code>metrics-only-serialization.rule</code>
      Only one serialization rule should be loaded. 
  </dd>
      <dt>
      <code> rss </code>
  </dt>
  <dd> 
      Supplying network and host configuration data to the RSS is
      very network specific. Each test site has its own rules which
      tap into the local sources of system information. If you are
      running at the TIC, you should load the rules in <code>rss/tic</code>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3> Sensors Components </h3>

<p><b>Metrics Sensors</b> collect data about the status of Cougaar
Plugins, Agents, Nodes and Society. Raw Sensors collect data in the
form of a service with a table of just contains running counts. This table must
be post-processed to generate useful statistics. Statistics Sensors
post process raw sensor data to derive metrics which are published to
the MetricsUpdater Service

<h3> Gossip Components </h3>

  <dd>

<h3> Servlets Components</h3>
<p>org.cougaar.core.qos.metrics.MetricsServletPlugin This NodeAgent
plugin starts five servlets: AgentLoadServlet, which displays a table
of per-agent load and message counts; RemoteAgentServlet, which
displays a table of various other per-agent metrics;
NodeResourcesServlet, which displays a table of various node/host
metrics; The MetricQueryServlet which allows remote quering metrics
      through  the http protocol; and NodeTrafficServlet which
      displays the message traffic into and out of an agent.

<p> org.cougaar.core.mts.StatisticsPlugin This NodeAgent plugin
installs the StatisticsServlet, which displays message statistics in a
web page.  You will course also need to include
org.cougaar.core.mts.StatisticsAspect in the list of loaded aspects.

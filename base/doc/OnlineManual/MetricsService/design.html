<p> The core underlying infrastructure used by the Metrics Services is
the <em>Resource Status Service</em> (RSS).  The RSS accepts low-level
tagged input in the form of key-value pairs, which it can process very
efficiently.  The entities which handle this input are known as
<em>DataFeeds</em>. This low-level data is then propagated through a
hierarchical graph of data-encapuslating nodes known as
<em>DataScopes</em>, using both forward and backward chaining.  Each
DataScope supports one or more <em>DataFormulas</em>, each of which in
turn can calculate a value using the encapsulated data as well as data
derived from other DataFormulas.  DataFormulas, in other words, form a
dependency chain that transforms and processes data.  The final result
of all this is raw sensor-like data coming in and processed
domain-relevant data going out.

<p>The specific subclasses of DataScope in any given RSS depends on
the domain.  In the case of COUGAAR, interesting DataScopes represent
Agents, Nodes, Hosts, inter-Agent data flows, inter-Host data flows,
etc.  Similarly, the specific subclasses of DataFeed in any given RSS
depends on the raw data sources that are available. In the case of
COUGAAR these would include URLs that provide default values in
property-list syntax, real-time measured host data (load average,
number of open sockets, etc), and data specified directly through the
MetricsUpdateService.

<p>Queries into the MetricsService use path specifications to indicate
the location of a given DataScope in the RSS knowledge base, and a
formula on that DataScope.  If the DataScope itself can handle the
query it will do so.  If not it will pass it to its parent.  This
makes it possible to ask, say, an Agent DataScope for Node or Host
data.



<p>Each COUGAAR Node includes its own RSS, which is primarily
responsible for handling local data in the Node.  In order to provide
a more global view, the GossipAspect was added.  Gossip defines a new
kind of DataFeed which is used for inter-RSS communication, and which
piggybacks requests and responses onto ordinary COUGAAR messge
traffic. This allows Nodes to share metrics without requiring any new
form of inter-Node communication. 


<p> As an example of how data moves through the RSS, the rest of this
section describes the flow of raw sensor data into the RSS from a
COUGAAR Component via the MetricsUpdateService, and back out again as
processed higher level data to some other Component via the
MetricsService. <i>The rest of this is still TBD</i>.

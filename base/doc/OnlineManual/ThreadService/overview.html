<title>Thread Services Overview</title>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p> The COUGAAR Thread Services are designed to replace the direct use
of Java Threads with a threading system that can be more tightly
controlled.  The central new interface is

<a href="Schedulable.html"><code>Schedulable</code></a>,
which can be thought of as taking the place of a Java native thread.
<code>Schedulables</code> are created and returned by the

<a href="ThreadService.html"><code>ThreadService</code></a> and
started by client code.  Unlike native Java threads,
<code>Schedulables</code> don't necessarily run immediately.  The
Threading Services allow only a certain number of threads to be
running at once.  If a <code>Schedulable</code> is started when all
threads slots are in use, it will be queued and will only run when
enough running threads have stopped to allow it reach the head of the
queue.  The maximum number of running <code>Schedulables</code> as
well as the queue ordering can be controlled by the

<a
href="ThreadControlService.html"><code>ThreadControlService</code></a>.
The Thread Services can also be used to schedule Java
<code>TimerTasks</code>.  </p>

<p> In addition to the running of threads and tasks, the COUGAAR
Thread Services offers two other features: an event-like mechanism for
receiving callbacks when 'interesting' events occur (<a
href="ThreadListenerService.html"><code>ThreadListenerService</code></a>),
and a certain amount of explicit control over scheduling (<a
href="ThreadControlService.html"><code>ThreadControlService</code></a>).
These interfaces, as well as the <code>Schedulable</code> and
<code>ThreadService</code> interfaces, are described in detail below.

<p> The COUGAAR Thread Services are hierchical.  Each Agent has a set
of Thread Services of its own, as does the MTS and certain other
Node-level components.  These local Thread Services handle threading
at their own level and are in turn controlled by a root Thread Service
at the Node level.  The inter-level control mechanism takes the form
of "rights" given by the higher to the lower level services, and
returned after use by the lower to the higher level services.  When
the higher level service has multiple children, a
<code>RightsSelector</code> is used to choose the child service that
will be the next to receive rights (round-robin by default).
In principle this hierarchy could be extended to a further depth
but so far we haven't found any good reason to do that in practice.
</p>

<p> Within a level, scheduling is further subdivided into lanes.
There are currently four hardwired lanes.  A lane is associated with a
<code>Schedulable</code> at creation time and remains fixed for the
lifetime of the <code>Schedulable</code>.

<p>The design of the thread services has important implications for
the runtime pattern of the <code>Runnables</code> it will be running.
In particular, it's not generally a good idea for these
<code>Runnables</code> to block.  The common Java pattern of a loop
with a <code>wait</code> or <code>sleep</code> call should usually be
unwrapped into a simple 'strip' of code that reschedules itself if it
needs to run again.  Examples can be seen in <a
href="usecases.html">Use Cases and Examples</a>.  Code which needs to
block or to use an unusual amount of resources should run in the
appropriate lane if at all possible. </p>

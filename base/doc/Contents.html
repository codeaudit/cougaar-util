<h3>BUILD ORGANIZATION</h3>
<p>
This is a list of the various zip files available from releases.
<p>
<table border=1>

cougaar.zip
</td><td>
Cougaar runtime - all "lib/" jar files, scripts, configuration files,
and minimum documentation.

where Bootstrapper will find them.
</td></tr><tr><td>
cougaar-api.zip

The javadoc for all the main cougaar classes in one place.  Unpacks
to the local directory, so you may wish to create a separate "api/"
directory.
</td></tr><tr><td>
cougaar-src.zip

so you may wish to create a separate "src/" directory.
</td></tr><tr><td>

<p>
Notes:
<ul>
<li>
You'll need cougaar.zip and cougaar-support.zip (the first time)
to get a runnable system.  The rest are extras.  Furthermore, the
cougaar-support contents do not change very often.
</li><p>
<li>
The zips are designed to be unpacked in the same directory, e.g.
on UNIX:
<pre>
       mkdir cougaar
       cd cougaar
       unzip /tmp/cougaar.zip
       unzip /tmp/cougaar-support.zip
       setenv COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH `pwd`
</pre></li><p>
<li>
The zips include version information in their respective
"Manifest/" directories.  The content looks something like:
<pre>
       NAME=cougaar-support
       COMMENT=cougaar thirdparty jars
       REPOSITORY_TAG=V10_0                 # CVS branch
       REPOSITORY_TIME=1/28/2003 13:00:08   # CVS checkout time
       ARCHIVE_TIME=1/28/2003 13:29:27      # zip time
</pre>
All your zips should have the same REPOSITORY_TAG and
REPOSITORY_TIME.  Each generated "lib/*.jar" file also contains
its version information.
</li><p>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>INTRA-MODULE ORGANIZATION</h3>
<p>
Each module subdirectory is organized in a similar way in the source
repository:
<table border=1>
<tr><td>
build.xml
</td><td>
ANT compilation script.
</td></tr><tr><td>
src/
</td><td>
Head of java sources for module, arranged like
javac would expect to see in a CLASSPATH.
</td></tr><tr><td>
bin/
</td><td>
Executables, scripts and support
</td></tr><tr><td>
data/
</td><td>
Arbitrary (static) data for runtime use.
</td></tr><tr><td>
doc/
</td><td>
Documentation, in text and html
</td></tr><tr><td>
configs/
</td><td>
Configuration directories.  Usually contains
only subdirectories, each is a valid
configuration.
</td></tr><tr><td>
examples/
</td><td>
Like src, but is never shipped compiled. 
The build process should attempt to
compile and regression-test anything in here,
but generated class files are never actually
shipped. 
</td></tr><tr><td>
regress/
</td><td>
Unit test sources for this module.  Will be
compiled and run by build process, reporting
on compile, runtime and test failures. produced
binaries are never installed or packaged.  test
should be the root of a java package tree -
consider following "junit" format conventions.
</td></tr><tr><td>
test/
</td><td>
For Cougaar integration team use.  May contain
additional regression tests and jigs.  Suggested
format for organizations submitting software
to the cougaar maintainers is a mirror of the
top directory, aimed at integrators.  Eg:
<pre>
    src/    integration sources
    doc/    integrations notes, etc
    data/
    configs/
    ...
</pre>
test will not be considered by autobuilds and
will not be (re)distributed.

<h3>PACKAGE ORGANIZATION</h3>
<p>
Software intended to replace core functionality should match the below
package layout (or provide detailed arguments why it should be
changed).
<p>
Software intended to augment the core and/or provide optional core
functionality, but is not intended to replace the "standard" software
suite, should mirror the above layout rooted in a new
"organization/project/product-specific" package rather override
the core's "org.cougaar" package names.  For example, an
alternate implementation of the agent base class
<pre>
    core/org.cougaar.core.agent.SimpleAgent
</pre>
which was optimized for small devices might be delivered as part of
company "foo"'s module as
<pre>
    fooco/com.foo.cougaar.palmtop.agent.EmbeddedAgent
</pre>
where:
<pre>
    "fooco/" is the module
    "com.foo." is the company package prefix
    "cougaar.palmtop." is the project's root
    "agent" is the parallel to the core's package.
    "EmbeddedAgent" is the class name
</pre>

None-core functionality should follow standard java package
arrangement standards and so should not interset with any core
packages.  In particular, "org.cougaar" may only be used by core
cougaar software, and use of "mil.darpa.log" may only be used on
approval. 

The current package map is documented in the latest "ReleaseNotes/"
directory, such as this Cougaar 10.0 package map:
<pre>
   <a href="ReleaseNotes/10.0/PackageMap.html"
   >ReleaseNotes/10.0/PackageMap.html</a>

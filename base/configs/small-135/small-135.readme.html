A new directory, configs/small-135, has been included
to allow some small tests of this release. Its name reflects the scope
of the tests it is designed to support: Classes 1, 3, 4, and 5 (Subsistence,
Fuel, Construction Materiel, and Ammunition) as well as Strategic Transportation.
<p>This config directory includes a node file, configs/small-135/SMALL-135-TRANS-NODE.ini,
which can be run on a single machine. This node includes 27 clusters, which
fall into the several logical groups.
<p>Here is a <a href="images/SMALL-135-NODE-descrip.jpg">diagram</a> and
a listing of these groups and descriptions of their primary functions in
this community:

<br><b><font size=+1>Functions of the Organizations in SMALL-135-NODE:</font></b>
<p><b>Top-level Command Organizations:</b>
<blockquote>The OPLAN and GetLogSupport tasks originate at NCA, and propagate
down
<br>to the other organizations</blockquote>
<b>Divisional and Divisional Support Organizations:</b>
<blockquote><b>3ID-HHC</b> distributes the OPLAN and GetLogSupport tasks
to subordinates.
<p>Also it is the StrategicTransportationProvider for all of its subordinates.
In turn, TRANSCOM is the StrategicTransportationProvider for 3ID-HHC. In
this way, all StrategicTransport tasks go from each deploying organization,
directly through 3ID-HHC, and then to TRANSCOM.
<p><b>703-MSB </b>(Main Support Battalion) serves as an inventory manager
for the lower level Support Battalions (FSBs or Forward Support Battalions.
3-DISCOM-HHC is the manager for 703-MSB and passes the OPLAN and GetLogSupport
Task to 703-MSB.</blockquote>
<b>Interim Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) Organizations</b>
<blockquote>This is a skeleton of the IBCT organizations.
<p><b>3-BDE-2ID-HHC</b> is the Headquarters of the IBCT. It passes the
OPLAN and GetLogSupport Tasks to its subordinates.
<p><b>1-23-INFBN</b> is the lone combat organization in this IBCT subset.
It generates demand for Fuel and Ammunition, based on its equipment (major
end items). In the current test config, this does not work, as this organization
only has aggregate assets, and by default, this demand is generated only
for individual assets. This organization does generate demand for Subsistence
(Food).
<p><b>296-SPTBN</b> is the support organization for the IBCT. In this limited
config, it provides Food (and Fuel and Ammo) to the 1-23-INFBN</blockquote>
<b>2nd Brigade Organizations:</b>
<blockquote>This is a skeleton of the 2nd BDE of the 3ID.
<p><b>2-BDE-3ID-HHC</b> is the Headquarters of the 2nd BDE of the 3ID.
It passes the OPLAN and GetLogSupport Tasks to its subordinates.
<p><b>2-7-INFBN</b> and <b>3-69-ARBN</b> are the combat organizations.
They generate demand for Fuel and Ammunition, based on their equipment
(major end items), and for Subsistence based on their personnel.
<p><b>3-FSB</b> is the support organization for the 2nd BDE. In this limited
config, it provides Food (and Fuel and Ammo) to 2-7-INFBN and 3-69-ARBN.</blockquote>

the Bulk POL (Fuel) and Packaged POL Supply provider for 110-QMCO-POLSPLY.
It is also the superior of two transportation companies: 416-TKCO-POL and
89-TKCO-CGO.
<p><b>416-TKCO-POL</b> is a theater transportation provider (FuelTransportProvider)
for 10-TCBN-HHC. It is just a stub in this limited test society, and has
a universal allocator for all Transport tasks.
<p><b>89-TKCO-CGO</b> is a theater transportation provider (MaterielTransportProvider)
for 10-TCBN-HHC. It transports Subsistence and Packaged POL.
<p><b>180-TCBN-HHC</b> is a Transportation Battalion, and is the superior
of the 418-TKCO-POL Company.
<p><b>418-TKCO-POL</b> is a theater transportation provider (FuelTransportProvider)

has a universal allocator for all Transport tasks.
<p><b>92-ENGBN-CBTHVY</b> is a Combat Heavy Engineering Battalion. It is
responsible for performing the three construction tasks: Build_Short_Runway,
Expand_Runway_Apron, and Build_Small_Tent_City. It uses a generic database
expander PlugIn to expand these three tasks into a wide variety of Construction
Materiel Supply tasks.</blockquote>
<b>CONUS Supply Organizations:</b>
<blockquote><b>DLAHQ</b> is a stub representing DLA. It has a universal
allocator for all Supply tasks. It is the SubsistenceSupplyProvider, FuelSupplyProvider,
PackagedPOLSupplyProvider for 10-TCBN-HHC.

tasks for ammunition containers to AmmoTRANSCOM.</blockquote>
<b>Strategic Transportation Provider Organization:</b>

<p><b>AmmoTRANSCOM</b> is a stub representing USTRANSCOM for ammunition
transportation. It has a universal allocator for all Transport Ammunition
tasks. It is the StrategicTransportationProvider for IOC.</blockquote>

<br>The ALP-8.2.1 release also a node file, SMALL-135-NODE.ini., which
is the same as SMALL-135-TRANS-NODE.ini., except that it excludes the TRANSCOM
and AmmoTRANSCOM clusters.&nbsp; This node is designed to run on a single
machine, while another node, representing TRANSCOM and AmmoTRANSCOM, and
the rest of the Transportation Community&nbsp; is run on a second machine.
This second node is defined by the node file, tops/configs/demo-config/configs/SmallTopsNode.ini.
This node consists of 37 clusters, which fall into several logical groups
for StrategicTransportation.

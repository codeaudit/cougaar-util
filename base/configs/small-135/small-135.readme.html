The directory, configs/small-135, has been included to
allow some small tests of this release. Its name reflects the scope of
the tests it is designed to support: Classes 1, 3, 4, and 5 (Subsistence,
Fuel, Construction Materiel, and Ammunition) as well as Strategic Transportation.
<p>This config directory includes a node file, configs/small-135/SMALL-135-TRANS-NODE.ini,
which can be run on a single machine. This node includes 26 clusters, which
fall into the several logical groups.
<p>Here is a <a href="images/SMALL-135-NODE-descrip.jpg">diagram</a> and
a listing of these groups and descriptions of their primary functions in
this community:

<br><b><font size=+1>Functions of the Organizations in SMALL-135-NODE:</font></b>
<p><b>Top-level Command Organizations:</b>
<blockquote>The OPLAN and GetLogSupport tasks originate at NCA, and propagate
down
<br>to the other organizations</blockquote>
<b>Divisional and Divisional Support Organizations:</b>
<blockquote><b>3ID-HHC</b> distributes the OPLAN and GetLogSupport tasks
to subordinates.
<p>Also it is the StrategicTransportationProvider for all of its subordinates.
In turn, TRANSCOM is the StrategicTransportationProvider for 3ID-HHC. In
this way, all StrategicTransport tasks go from each deploying organization,
directly through 3ID-HHC, and then to TRANSCOM.
<p><b>703-MSB </b>(Main Support Battalion) serves as an inventory manager
for the lower level Support Battalions (FSBs or Forward Support Battalions.
3-DISCOM-HHC is the manager for 703-MSB and passes the OPLAN and GetLogSupport
Task to 703-MSB.</blockquote>
<b>Interim Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) Organizations</b>
<blockquote>This is a skeleton of the IBCT organizations.
<p><b>3-BDE-2ID-HHC</b> is the Headquarters of the IBCT. It passes the
OPLAN and GetLogSupport Tasks to its subordinates.
<p><b>1-23-INFBN</b> is the lone combat organization in this IBCT subset.
It generates demand for Fuel and Ammunition, based on its equipment (major
end items). In the current test config, this does not work, as this organization
only has aggregate assets, and by default, this demand is generated only
for individual assets. This organization does generate demand for Subsistence
(Food).
<p><b>296-SPTBN</b> is the support organization for the IBCT. In this limited
config, it provides Food (and Fuel and Ammo) to the 1-23-INFBN</blockquote>
<b>2nd Brigade Organizations:</b>
<blockquote>This is a skeleton of the 2nd BDE of the 3ID.
<p><b>2-BDE-3ID-HHC</b> is the Headquarters of the 2nd BDE of the 3ID.
It passes the OPLAN and GetLogSupport Tasks to its subordinates.
<p><b>2-7-INFBN</b> and <b>3-69-ARBN</b> are the combat organizations.
They generate demand for Fuel and Ammunition, based on their equipment
(major end items), and for Subsistence based on their personnel.
<p><b>3-FSB</b> is the support organization for the 2nd BDE. In this limited
config, it provides Food (and Fuel and Ammo) to 2-7-INFBN and 3-69-ARBN.</blockquote>
<b>Combat Service Support Group Organizations:</b>
<blockquote>This is a skeleton of the 24th Support Group.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>24-SPTGP-HHC</b> is the Headquarters. It passes the OPLAN
and GetLogSupport Tasks to its subordinates.
<p><b>24-CSB-HHD</b> is a Corps Support Battalion, and is the superior
of the 110-QMCO-POLSPLY Company.
<p><b>110-QMCO-POLSPLY</b> is the Bulk POL (Fuel) and Packaged POL Supply
provider for 703-MSB
<p><b>553-CSB-HHD</b> is a Corps SUpport Battalion, and is a major inventory
manager for the society. In this subset, it is the SubsistenceSupplyProvider
for 703-MSB.
<p><b>10-TCBN-HHC</b> is another major inventory manager for the society.
In this subset, it is the SubsistenceSupplyProvider for 553-CSB-HHD, and
the Bulk POL (Fuel) and Packaged POL Supply provider for 110-QMCO-POLSPLY.
It is also the superior of two transportation companies: 416-TKCO-POL and
89-TKCO-CGO.
<p><b>416-TKCO-POL</b> is a theater transportation provider (FuelTransportProvider)
for 10-TCBN-HHC. It is just a stub in this limited test society, and has
a universal allocator for all Transport tasks.
<p><b>89-TKCO-CGO</b> is a theater transportation provider (MaterielTransportProvider)
for 10-TCBN-HHC. It transports Subsistence and Packaged POL.
<p><b>180-TCBN-HHC</b> is a Transportation Battalion, and is the superior
of the 418-TKCO-POL Company.
<p><b>418-TKCO-POL</b> is a theater transportation provider (FuelTransportProvider)
for 110-QMCO-POLSPLY. It is just a stub in this limited test society, and
has a universal allocator for all Transport tasks.
<p><b>92-ENGBN-CBTHVY</b> is a Combat Heavy Engineering Battalion. It is
responsible for performing the three construction tasks: Build_Short_Runway,
Expand_Runway_Apron, and Build_Small_Tent_City. It uses a generic database
expander PlugIn to expand these three tasks into a wide variety of Construction
Materiel Supply tasks.</blockquote>
<b>CONUS Supply Organizations:</b>
<blockquote><b>DLAHQ</b> is a stub representing DLA. It has a universal
allocator for all Supply tasks. It is the SubsistenceSupplyProvider, FuelSupplyProvider,
PackagedPOLSupplyProvider for 10-TCBN-HHC.
<p><b>IOC</b> is a stub representing the Industrial Operations Center.
It is the AmmunitionSupplyProvider for 3-FSB and 296-STPBN. It sends transport
tasks for ammunition containers to AmmoTRANSCOM.</blockquote>
<b>Strategic Transportation Provider Organization:</b>
<blockquote><b>TRANSCOM</b> is a stub representing USTRANSCOM. It has a
universal allocator for all Transport tasks (now including ammunition transport).
It is the StrategicTransportationProvider
for 3ID-HHC and for IOC.</blockquote>

<br>There is also a node file, SMALL-135-NODE.ini., which is the same as
SMALL-135-TRANS-NODE.ini., except that it excludes the TRANSCOM
cluster.&nbsp; This node is designed to run on a single machine, while
another node, representing TRANSCOM and the rest of the
Transportation Community&nbsp; is run on a second machine. This second
node is defined by the node file:
glmtrans/configs/demo-config/config/GLMTransNode.ini. This node consists
of 7 clusters, which fall into several logical groups for StrategicTransportation.

<p><b><font size=+1>To run the society on a single machine</font></b>
<p>This society will&nbsp; have the Demand Community on one machine, and
will employ stub clusters for the Transportation Community on that same
machine.
<ol>
<li>
Make sure that COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH is set properly to the top release
directory</li>

<li>
cd to $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/configs/small-135/</li>

<li>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><font size=+1>To run the society on a two machines:</font></b>
<p>This society will have the Demand Community on one machine, and the
Transportation Community on the other.
<p>Start the Demand Community on the first machine:
<ol>
<li>
Make sure that COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH is set properly to the top release
directory</li>

<li>
cd to $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/configs/small-135/</li>

<li>
Type Node SMALL-135-NODE</li>
</ol>
Start the Transportation Community on the second machine:
<ol>
<li>
Make sure that COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH is set properly to the top release
directory</li>

<li>
cd to $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/glmtrans/configs/demo-config/configs</li>

<li>
Type Node GLMTransNode</li>
</ol>
Since the Transportation Community has been greatly simplified, and is
now much smaller than in previous releases (7 clusters versus 37 clusters),
it should be possible to run both nodes in a single machine, provided there
is enough memory (at least about 400 MBytes).

<p><b><font size=+1>Expected Results</font></b>
<p>Regardless of the mode in which the system is run, Inventory graphs
such as the following should be produced. To run the Inventory graph:
<ol>
<li>
cd to $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/bin</li>

<li>
Type CUI_Inventory</li>

<li>
Set the Theme to "COUGAAR"</li>

<li>

<li>
Choose a Commodity</li>

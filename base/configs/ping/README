Simple example of core's ping support, useful for infrastructure
and message transport testing.

Add this system property to your Node script to enable logging:
  -Dorg.cougaar.core.logging.config.filename=log.props

Optionally add these properties to enable persistence and turn
up the frequency to every 15 seconds:
  -Dorg.cougaar.core.persistence.enable=true
  -Dorg.cougaar.core.persistence.lazyInterval=15000

See "AgentA.ini" for notes on how to configure the pings.  The 
provided configuration will send an endless series of pings from 
AgentA to AgentB, one per second.  One can modify the agent ".ini" 
files to increase the number of pings or change their frequency.

See the package-level javadocs in
  org/cougaar/core/mobility/ping/package.html
for additional usage and testing notes.

A scripted agent mobility test is illustrated by the MoverAgent.
The test will move AgentA from NodeA to NodeB and back in an 
endless loop, pausing for 30 seconds between each move.  See
"MoverAgent.ini" for details.

# Another example agent mobility script.  See "moveScript.txt"
# for a simplified example.
#
# This script moves agents AgentA and AgentB back and forth 
# between nodes NodeA and NodeB.  The initial setup is expected
# to be AgentA on NodeA and AgentB on NodeB, which we'll write
# as:
#   NodeA:{AgentA}          NodeB:{AgentB}
#
# Our first step is to move AgentB to NodeB:
#   NodeA:{}                NodeB:{AgentA, AgentB}
# next we'll move AgentB to complete the swap:
#   NodeA:{AgentB}          NodeB:{AgentA}
# next we'll move AgentA to put both agents on NodeA:
#   NodeA:{AgentA, AgentB}  NodeB:{}
# lastly, to return to our initial config, we'll move AgentB:
#   NodeA:{AgentA}  NodeB:{AgentB}
# then we'll loop again.
#
# For each step we'll wait for 1 minute between the moves.

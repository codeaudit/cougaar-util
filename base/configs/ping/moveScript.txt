# Example agent mobility script
#
# This script moves AgentA back and forth between nodes 
# NodeA and NodeB, on an endless loop.
# 
# See "org.cougaar.core.examples.mobility.ldm.ScriptParser" for 
# further details.


# begin a loop
label top

# move commands look like:
#   move actor, [+^@]pause, [+^@]timeout, mobile, origin, dest, [true]
# below I'll provide an example.

# have this agent make the request
# wait until 30 seconds after the prior move has started (^0:30)
# timeout if this move takes longer than 1 minute (+1:00)
# request that AgentA be moved to NodeB
# we don't care which node AgentA is inially at (, ,)
# if AgentA is already on NodeB, then force its restart (true)
move , ^:30, +1:00, AgentA,, NodeB, true

# ditto, except move AgentA to NodeA
move , ^:30, +1:00, AgentA,, NodeA, true

# you can imagine similar lines for agent & node combinations...

# loop back to the top!
goto top

# never reach here.

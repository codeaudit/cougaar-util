configs/examples

This directory contains miscellaneous example configurations. These
configurations are not guaranteed to be useful or interesting, or
even to run consistently. They should only be used as sample
configuration files. The open source community may choose to maintain
the underlying software to run these configurations, but the core Cougaar
team has no immediate plans to do so.

Configurations:
small-135/
   The small-135 configuration was originally our largest configuration,
using military logistics. It is no longer supported. In particular, 
the Plugins which it uses are no longer actively supported, and
the domain database which it depends on has been changed to support
our latest military logistics configuration, developed under the
Ultra*Log program, and available from the CSMART configuration database.
For details on this configuration, see small-135/small-135.readme.html

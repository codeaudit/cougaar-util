To do COUGAAR development with IDEA, check out the modules you want in a
common directory, then copy cougaar.ipr into that same common parent directory.
The copied cougaar.ipr can then be launched, or opened in IDEA.  The checked-in
ipr file is for reference only and won't work if used directly.  If you only
check out some of the supported COUGAAR modules you'll probably need to modify
the copied ipr file, since it assumes all the modules are there.

The COUGAAR modules that currently have checked-in iml files are: base, bootstrap,
build, core, jars, mtsstd, ping, qos, qrs, tools, uti, webserver, webtomcat.  Note
that dependencies might require you to check out modules you're not actively working
in.  For instance the webtomcat module depends on webserver, which in turn depends
on core, which depends on util, which depends on bootstrap, which depends on jars.
So if you're working in webtomcat, you would need all the others as well.

# boost runs an arbitrary java class using the cougaar bootstrapper
# usage:  boost [-v] [-preoptions ...] my.class.Name [-postoptions ...]
#   -v  outputs debugging information to stdout during the script's execution
#   -preoptions are passed as VM arguments, generally -D args, but must start with "-"
#   my.class.Name the name of the class to run
#   -postoptions are passed as Node arguments (e.g. after the node classname) and may be of
#      any form understood by the Node class
# 
# The environment variable $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH should be set to the installed location
# of Cougaar if not set, the script will check $CIP and then will attempt to 
# guess based on where the Node script is located.
#
# Unlike Node, boost does not set any of the assorted VM parameters or
# cougaar-application related options.  Only COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH is passed to the
# bootstrapper.

<font size=+2>Some notes on the <tt>org.cougaar.tools.server</tt> code:</font>

<p>

There are three important interfaces for a Console designer:<pre>
  "CommunityServesClient"
  "NodeServesClient"
  "NodeEventListener"</pre>

<p>

The "CommunityServesClient" allows the client (console) to create
new nodes (NodeServesClient) and register a listener for activities
within the node (NodeEventListener).  The "NodeServesClient" and
"NodeEventListener" interfaces are simple for now, but more capabilities
will be added in the future.

<p>

"NodeServer" is used to create the server-daemon process on the
remote hosts -- this daemon listens for "createNode" requests and
spawns the appropriate processes.  The "*.props" files are used
to configure the properties used in creating the node.

<p>

The "org.cougaar.tools.server.examples" package, with source under
"server/examples/*", contains two example consoles:<ul>
  <li>"MinConsole", which is a command-line test rig</li>
  <li>"GuiConsole", which is simple Swing-based UI</li>
</ol>
Also see the "CSMARTConsole", which is integrated into CSMART.

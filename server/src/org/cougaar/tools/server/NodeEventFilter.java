   *            <tt>NodeEventListener.handleAll(..)</tt> --
   *            The Node can impose an upper-bound that is less than
   *            Integer.MAX_VALUE at it's discretion (For example, never
   *            buffer more than 1000 NodeEvents) and/or flush a smaller
   *            number of buffered NodeEvents at any time (For example, the 
   *            Node can send if it's memory is running low)
   *
   *   1 or 0:  No buffering -- the Node will use 
   *            <tt>NodeEventListener.handle(..)</tt> to send each NodeEvent 
   *            separately, which is significantly less efficent than "&gt; 1"
   *            but allows for continual updates
   *
   *   &lt; 0:    Similar to the "&gt; 1" case, but the Node will discard
   *            buffered NodeEvents in excess of the Math.abs(..) of the
   *            specified amount instead of pushing them on the Client,
   *            which means that the Client must use
   *            <tt>NodeServesClient.flushNodeEvents()</tt> to periodically
   *            request the buffered NodeEvents -- For example, "-100" tells 
   *            the Node to buffer at most 100 NodeEvents and then discard 
   *            to prevent overflow, where the Node might decide to throw 
   *            away the oldest 25 NodeEvents in the buffer if the buffer 
   *            size grows over 100
   * <pre>
   * .
   * <p>
   * These definitions are intentionally ambiguous to prevent the Client 
   * from burdening the Node.  If the Client requires a more strict 
   * definition (time-frequency, etc) then it must poll.
   * <p>
   * The Client can use <tt>NodeServesClient.flushNodeEvents()</tt> to 
   * flush all buffered NodeEvents.
   * <p>
   * Note that NodeEvent's of type <tt>NodeEvent.HEARTBEAT</tt> are 
   * <u>not</u> buffered -- these simply allow the Node to track the
   * existence of the Client and destroy itself if the Client dies!

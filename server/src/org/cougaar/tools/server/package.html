<h2>Notes on the app-server</h2>

<p>

The "App-Server" is an application server (daemon) that allows 
remote clients to:
<ol>
  <li>launch and kill processes, plus listen for the output
      of those processes</li>
  <li>access the file system to read and write files</li>
  <li>list running processes on the system ("ps")</li>
</ol>

<p>

As of Cougaar 9.0 there is little security built into the
server, so <i><b>use at your own risk</b></i>.  If the 
machines are behind a firewall then you're probably okay...

<p>

The <code>AppServer</code> is the "main" program to launch the 
server.  The default port address is 8484.  ".props" filenames
that are specified as arguments are loaded by the server and
used to set default process properties.

<p>

The <code>RemoteHostRegistry</code> allows a remote client to lookup 
an app-server on a specified (host:port) address.

<p>

There are several example app-server clients:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The "org.cougaar.tools.server.examples" package, with source under
"server/examples/*", contains two example consoles:<ul>
  <li>"MinConsole", which is a command-line test rig</li>
  <li>"GuiConsole", which is simple Swing-based UI</li>
</ol>
</li><p>

<li>
The "CSMARTConsole", which is integrated into CSMART.
</li><p>

<li>
The "Manager", which is in the "manager" module.
</li><p>
</ul>

<p>

<i>FIXME:</i><br>
The interfaces have a lot of "throws Exception" in them, which
is messy.  With a little work most of these methods could probably 
become something more specific, such as "throws IOException".

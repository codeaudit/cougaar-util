This is the ALP (node) server module.

To run the server:

	java alp.server.ALPServer [<site.props> ..]
or
	java -jar server.jar [<site.props> ...]
or (if your system allows jar file execution):
	server.jar [<site.props> ..]

"<site.props>" is zero or more optional files which should (minimally)
specify where alp.install.path and the minimal classpath needed to
start a node. 

The server accumulates properties by reading properties from the
following locations (in order):
	System.Properties	(of the server VM - e.g. -D arguments)
	Common.props		(usually in the jar file)
	Windows.props		(iff the OS is a windows varient)
	<OS>.props 		(where <OS> is the OS of the machine
				e.g. "Linux".  If the OS name has
				embedded spaces, they are replaced
				with '_' characters - e.g. "Windows_NT.props")
	<site.props>		(any passed arguments)

Later properties have precedence.


To run the client (Console):

	java alp.server.Console hosts config props

where:
	hosts = a file with a list of hosts where the server might be running.
	config = a file with a list of node names that might be run
	props = a file with additional properties to send to the
		client.
The console props file will add properties to those of the server to
determine the final set used to start the Node.  Many server control
properties cannot be overriden from the console side.

See the documentation file Properties.txt for a list of the standard
properties used and syntax.

The first node to be run will be assigned to run the nameserver for
the society.  The port(s) to be used are determined by the
alp.server.nameserver.ports property in the argument props or
"8888:5555". The first number is the nameserver port.  The second
number is the PSP (webserver) port.  There is no need to supply this
parameter unless multiple people are running nodes on the same machine 
(server).

Once running, the user selects a node from column A and a machine from 
column B and then presses the run button to launch the node.  The
output from that node will appear in a new tabbed text display.

# Sample script for running the Node Server.
#
# Be sure to edit the COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH and NODE_PROPS_FILE 
# properties below.
#
# Note that CSMART may writes configuration files to the current 
# working directory.


# Set the COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH, which is the base directory for the
# COUGAAR installation
#set COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH=/opt/cougaar

# Specify the host-specific properties file, which defines *all*
# the Node installation-specific properties.
#
# The ".props" file must be modified to match your installation.  An
# example is provided with this release:
#
#    server/data/unix-server-sample.props
#
# The above example includes documentation details.
#
# Some additional properties are set by CSMART at run time, such 
# as the Node's name, but otherwise this ".props" file specifies 
# the full configuration.
#
# Note that Server properties are *not* passed to the Node -- 
# only the properties in the ".props" file are passed.  For
# example, the classpath for the Node is read from the file.
#
# Also see the Server documentation ("server/doc/README") for 
# further details.

# Sample script for running the Node Server.
#
# Be sure to edit the COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH and NODE_PROPS_FILE 
# properties below.
#
# Note that CSMART may writes configuration files to the current 
# working directory.


# Set the COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH, which is the base directory for the
# COUGAAR installation
#COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH=/opt/alp

# Specify the host-specific properties file, which defines *all*
# the Node installation-specific properties.
#
# The ".props" file must be modified to match your installation.  An
# example is provided with this release:
#
#    server/data/unix-server-sample.props
#
# The above example includes documentation details.
#
# Some additional properties are set by CSMART at run time, such 
# as the Node's name, but otherwise this ".props" file specifies 
# the full configuration.
#
# Note that Server properties are *not* passed to the Node -- 
# only the properties in the ".props" file are passed.  For
# example, the classpath for the Node is read from the file.
#
# Also see the Server documentation ("server/doc/README") for 
# further details.
NODE_PROPS_FILE="server.props"

#
# The remaining settings should not require modifications
# unless you are debugging or have a custom COUGAAR installation.
#


# Specify the optional properties for the server itself.
#
# All server properties start with "-Dorg.cougaar.tools.server."
# and only modify the Server's behavior.  See the Server 
# documentation ("server/doc/README") for details.
#
#SERVERCONFIG="-Dorg.cougaar.tools.server.verbose=true"
SERVERCONFIG=""

# Specify the classpath for loading the Server.
#
# Below we set the AppServer's classpath to:
#  $COUGAAR_DEV_PATH	if defined
#  $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/lib/server.jar
#  $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/lib/csmart.jar
#
# This is only useful to altering the Server's codebase,
# *not* the Node's codebase.  The ".props" file must be
# modified to alter the Node's configuration.

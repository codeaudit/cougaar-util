# Set the Cougaar install path.

# Set the Cougaar worskpace. This is the parent directory for all
#  runtime output by Plugins, etc. It defaults to CIP\workspace
#  and is usually defined by the environment variable COUGAAR_WORKSPACE
org.cougaar.workspace=D\:\\opt\\cougaar\\workspace

# Set the cougaar system path, which is used to find third-party jars
#   (e.g. "log4j.jar").
#
# This defaults to "{org.cougaar.install.path} + \\sys", but one can

# Add the "java-io-patch" to allow Cougaar persistence and Agent Mobility.

# Set the config path, which uses ";" separators.
#
# Note that this should end with an (escaped) semi-colon to indicate
# that the path specified here should be searched in addition to and 
# before the default search path.
#
# This path must contain your "cougaar.rc", database files ("*.q"), 
#   "default.psps.xml", and other configuration files.
#
# Here we override the default configuration path to include both
# the "common" directory and "GLMTrans" directory.

# Use the Server HotSpot Java Virtual Machine
# Warning: The JRE does not include this VM. You must have the full

# of java.exe is usually placed). 
# If you get an error like: Error: no `server' JVM at `C:\Program

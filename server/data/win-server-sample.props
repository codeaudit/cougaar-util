# Set the cougaar system path, which is used to find third-party jars
#   (e.g. "log4j.jar").
#
# This defaults to "{org.cougaar.install.path} + \\sys", but one can

# Add the "java-io-patch" to allow Cougaar persistence.
#
# If persistence is disabled then this has no effect.  For simplicity
# this "java-io-patch" jar should always be included.  Since this jar
# overrides "java.io" it must be prepended to the JVM's bootclasspath.

#
# Note that this should end with an (escaped) semi-colon to indicate
# that the path specified here should be searched in addition to and 
# before the default search path.
#
# This path must contain your "cougaar.rc", database files ("*.q"),

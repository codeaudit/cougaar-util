#   list of properties.

# Note that some symbols, such as ";", must be encoded ("\;")

# Set the Cougaar install path.
org.cougaar.install.path=/opt/cougaar

# Set the cougaar system path, which is used to find third-party jars
#   (e.g. "log4j.jar").
#
# This defaults to "{org.cougaar.install.path} + /sys", but one can
#   use a different directory by setting this property.
#org.cougaar.system.path=/opt/cougaar/sys

# Enable or disable persistence.
#
# By default persistence is disabled.
#org.cougaar.core.persistence.enable=true

# Add the "java-io-patch" to allow Cougaar persistence.
#
# If persistence is disabled then this has no effect.  For simplicity
# this "java-io-patch" jar should always be included.  Since this jar
# overrides "java.io" it must be prepended to the JVM's bootclasspath.

# Set the class path for starting the Node, which uses ":" separators.
#
# Typically only core.jar needs to be in here.
java.class.path=/opt/cougaar/lib/core.jar

# Set the config path, which uses ";" separators.
#
# Note that this must end with an (escaped) semi-colon to indicate
# that the path specified here should in addition to the default
# search path.
#
# This path must contain your "cougaar.rc", database files ("*.q"), 
#   "default.psps.xml", and other configuration files.
#
# Here we override the default configuration path to include both
# the "common" directory and "GLMTrans" directory.

# In general, the CSMART UI will be on host "csmarthost" with multiple
#   server hosts, "serverhost[1-N]".  For the display to work (AWT, 
#   Swing, etc) each "serverhost[1-N]" needs "env.DISPLAY=csmarthost:0.0" 
#   and the CSMART UI host needs "xhost +serverhost1 .. +serverhostN" 
#   (or just "xhost +").
#
# On some machines you may need to use the full machine name.

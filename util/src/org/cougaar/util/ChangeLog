	* log/log4j/LoggerImpl.java:
	Bug #2743 -- Dots and other characters printed to System.err/out
	interfere with logging 
	The actual implementation of printDots is here. If the underlying
	Category (Logger) has any Appender that is a ConsoleAppender or if
	additivity is true and any ancestor Category has a
	ConsoleAppender, enable dot checking. If dot checking is on,
	before printing any log output, check if any dot printing has
	happened since the last log output. If it has, print an eol before
	performing the logging output. When printLog is called if there
	are no preceding dots, print a timestamp first before printing the
	dots. Count the number of characters printed this way.

	* log/NullLogger.java:
	Bug #2743 -- Dots and other characters printed to System.err/out
	interfere with logging 
	Add printDot method (does nothing).

	* log/Logging.java:
	Bug #2743 -- Dots and other characters printed to System.err/out
	interfere with logging
	Add convenience method for calling printDot without a Logger or
	LoggingService.

	* log/LoggerProxy.java: 
	Bug #2743 -- Dots and other characters printed to System.err/out
	interfere with logging
	Pass through printDot to underlying Logger.

	* log/Logger.java:
	Bug #2743 -- Dots and other characters printed to System.err/out
	interfere with logging
	Add printDot method to allow applications to print dots and
	similar output without messing up the logging output.

	* log/log4j/Log4jLoggerFactory.java:
	Bug #2478 -- Circularity between logger and config finder
	Configure logging with the default logging configuration defined
	in org.cougaar.util.log.log4j.Initializer before using the
	ConfigFinder and then reconfigure with the logging config file (if
	any). For reference, default configuration is:
	log4j.rootCategory=WARN,A1
	log4j.appender.A1=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
	log4j.appender.A1.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
	log4j.appender.A1.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} %-5p [%c{1}] - %m%n

	* log/log4j/DetailPriority.java: 
	Bug #1645 -- Additional logging level needed for extreme detail
	Added DETAIL logging level just before DEBUG. All other logging
	levels have been moved up by one. Remember to specify the priority
	class in logging configuration files:
	DETAIL#org.cougaar.util.log.log4j.DetailPriority 

	* log/LoggerAdapter.java: 
	* log/Logger.java:
	Bug #1645 -- Additional logging level needed for extreme detail

	Fix BOZO comments. There is no BOZO. New comments explain the
	situation that was apparently anomalous to the previous commenter.
	No code was harmed or otherwise changed in the performance of this
	edit.

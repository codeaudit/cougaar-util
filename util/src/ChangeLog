	Bug #3279 -- plugin binders and persistence
	Add debug logging to help diagnose this problem.

	* org/cougaar/core/component/ContainerSupport.java:
	Bug #3278 -- plugin binders and persistence
	captureState did not include binder factories in the
	ComponentDescriptions returned. The means that binder
	factories are omitted after rehydration.
	Keep track of the binder factories and include in
	the value of captureState.

	* org/cougaar/util/ConfigFinder, .../jar/*
	Added contributed configs-from-jar functionality from CSI.

	* org/cougaar/core/component/BindingUtility.java:
	Bug #2658 -- Components incompatible with automatic service revocation feature
	Call service setters with a null service before setting the real
	service during load. This will help flush out instances where null
	services are improperly handled. Without this, such cases will not
	be found until the component is unloaded. This should probably be
	removed eventually.

	* org/cougaar/core/component/ServiceBrokerSupport.java:
	Bug #1514
	Fixes agent hang due to deadlock. Caused by ServiceBrokerSupport
	holding the servicesLock while getting a service from the
	blackboard service provider. The blackboard service provider needs
	access to the distributor that may be held by a plugin needing to
	get a service to send ABA messages.
	The fix holds the lock only long enough to get the service
	provider and separately locks the service provider to enforce
	one-at-at-time access to the service provider.

	* org/cougaar/core/component/ServiceBrokerSupport.java:
	Bug #2014 -- SchedulerServiceProvider causes deadlock
	Actually caused by using the service broker for getting a service
	from within a ServiceListener. Getting a service requires locking
	the service provider and if the service provider is locked by a
	thread that is trying to add a service listener for the same
	service provider, deadlock ensues.
	This is a quick fix to copy out the listeners List so the listener
	lock does not need to be held while listeners are invoked. It is
	conceivable that adding the listener does not require locking the
	service provider, but that will take more study. This is
	guaranteed to fix the problem at the expense of an array.

	* org/cougaar/core/component/AddonServiceBroker.java:
	Fix bug releaseService should call delegate.releaseService, not
	itself.

2002-06-05  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/util/ChainingIterator
	Utility for combining any number of iterators into a single
	ordered iterator.

	* occ/component/ContainedService
	ContainedService implements an alternative route for getting
	control and information about the components context.  This
	initial implementation just provides the component with the
	ComponentDescription used to load it, if available.  Simplest way
	to use it is to extend ContainedBinderSupport rather than
	BinderSupport for your binder.
	
	* occ/component/ContainedBinderSupport
	Makes available a ContainedService implementation to the binder's
	direct child, using AddonServiceBroker.
	
	* occ/component/AddonServiceBroker
	Implements a component-local service provider attached to a
	forwarding ServiceBroker.  Used by ContainedBinderSupport.

	* occ/component/BinderBase
	Add setter method for serviceBroker so that it can be caught.

	* org/cougaar/util/log/LoggerFactory.java
	Refactored logger facility, added ability to specify factory
	implementation, implemented singleton, simplified API.
	
	* org/cougaar/util/log/LoggerAdapter.java, LoggerProxy.java, NullLogger.java
	New adapter class implements api in terms of two abstract
	methods.  Refactored other implementations to use it.

	* org/cougaar/util/log/log4j/Log4jLoggerFactory.java
	refactored.  Moved property parsing code from core
	(LoggingService) to here, simplified API.

	* org/cougaar/util/log/log4j/LoggerImpl.java
	refactor in terms of LoggerAdapter
	
	* org/cougaar/util/log/log4j/Util.java
	use log4j priority constants.

	* org/cougaar/util/log/NullLoggerFactory.java
	Implement LoggerFactory for real for nulls.

	* org/cougaar/util/log/Logging.java
	New utility class for simplified, static access to loggers.
	Incudes logger cache and facility for setting up and retrieving
	thread-specific loggers.

	* org/cougaar/core/component/ComponentDescriptions.java
	Make extractDirectComponents work correctly, though it was
	previously unused.  Add some javadoc.

	* org/cougaar/core/component/ContainerSupport.java
	Implement Collection.addAll(). Make externalComponentDescription
	api a little cleaner 

2002-05-17  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/component/ComponentFactory.java
	Now pays attention to ComponentDescription.getCodebase.
	Fixes bug 1029.

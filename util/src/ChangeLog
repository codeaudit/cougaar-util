	* org/cougaar/util/ChainingIterator
	Utility for combining any number of iterators into a single
	ordered iterator.

	* occ/component/ContainedService
	ContainedService implements an alternative route for getting
	control and information about the components context.  This
	initial implementation just provides the component with the
	ComponentDescription used to load it, if available.  Simplest way
	to use it is to extend ContainedBinderSupport rather than
	BinderSupport for your binder.
	
	* occ/component/ContainedBinderSupport
	Makes available a ContainedService implementation to the binder's
	direct child, using AddonServiceBroker.
	
	* occ/component/AddonServiceBroker
	Implements a component-local service provider attached to a
	forwarding ServiceBroker.  Used by ContainedBinderSupport.

	* occ/component/BinderBase
	Add setter method for serviceBroker so that it can be caught.

	* org/cougaar/util/log/LoggerFactory.java
	Refactored logger facility, added ability to specify factory
	implementation, implemented singleton, simplified API.
	
	* org/cougaar/util/log/LoggerAdapter.java, LoggerProxy.java, NullLogger.java
	New adapter class implements api in terms of two abstract
	methods.  Refactored other implementations to use it.

	* org/cougaar/util/log/log4j/Log4jLoggerFactory.java
	refactored.  Moved property parsing code from core
	(LoggingService) to here, simplified API.

	* org/cougaar/util/log/log4j/LoggerImpl.java
	refactor in terms of LoggerAdapter
	
	* org/cougaar/util/log/log4j/Util.java
	use log4j priority constants.

	* org/cougaar/util/log/NullLoggerFactory.java
	Implement LoggerFactory for real for nulls.

	* org/cougaar/util/log/Logging.java
	New utility class for simplified, static access to loggers.
	Incudes logger cache and facility for setting up and retrieving
	thread-specific loggers.

	* org/cougaar/core/component/ComponentDescriptions.java
	Make extractDirectComponents work correctly, though it was
	previously unused.  Add some javadoc.

	* org/cougaar/core/component/ContainerSupport.java
	Implement Collection.addAll(). Make externalComponentDescription
	api a little cleaner

	* Bootstrapper
	Use XURLClassLoader rather than BootstrapClassLoader to avoid a
	fragile classpath.  This means that application jars, in general,
	must not appear on the classpath when using bootstrapper, or we
	risk classloader namespace interaction problems.  Fixes RFE 1434
	and BUG 1413.

	Also added a system property org.cougaar.bootstrap.classloader.class 
	to allow specification of the classloader to use without having to
	write a new bootstrapper implementation.
